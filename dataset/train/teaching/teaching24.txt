Next, we show the effect of the substr function.
Statement Effect
cout << sentence.substr(0, 5) << endl; Outputs: It is
cout << sentence.substr(6, 6) << endl; Outputs: cloudy
cout << sentence.substr(6, 16) << endl; Outputs: cloudy and warm.
cout << sentence.substr(17, 10) << endl; Outputs: warm.
cout << sentence.substr(3, 6) << endl; Outputs: is clo
str = sentence.substr(0, 8); str = "It is cl"
str = sentence.substr(2, 10); str = " is cloudy"
The following program illustrates how to use the string function substr.
//Example: substr function
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
8
string sentence; //Line 1
string str; //Line 2
sentence = "It is cloudy and warm."; //Line 3
cout << "Line 4: substr(0, 5) in \""
<< sentence << "\" = \""
<< sentence.substr(0, 5) << "\"" << endl; //Line 4
cout << "Line 5: substr(6, 6) in \""
<< sentence << "\" = \""
<< sentence.substr(6, 6) << "\"" << endl; //Line 5
cout << "Line 6: substr(6, 16) in \""
<< sentence << "\" = " << endl
<< " \"" << sentence.substr(6, 16)
<< "\"" << endl; //Line 6
cout << "Line 7: substr(17, 10) in \""
<< sentence << "\" = \""
<< sentence.substr(17, 10) << "\"" << endl; //Line 7
cout << "Line 8: substr(3, 6) in \""
<< sentence << "\" = \""
<< sentence.substr(3, 6) << "\"" << endl; //Line 8
