100 Chapter 3. Solving Problems by Searching 
(a) After expanding Arad. Sibiu, 
and Rkunieu  Vilcea   
(b) After unwinding back to Sibiu 
and expanding Fagaras 
(c) After switching back to Rimnicu  Vilcea 
and expanding Pitesti   
Figure 3.27 Stages in an RBFS  search for the shortest route to Bucharest. The f-limit 
value for each recursive call is shown on top of each current node, and every node is labeled 
with its f-cost.   (a) The path via Rimnicu  Vilcea is followed until the current best leaf (Pitesti) 
has a value that is worse than the best alternative path (Fagaras).  (b) The recursion unwinds 
and the best leaf value of the forgotten subtree  (417) is backed up to Rirnnicu  Vilcea;  then 
Fagaras is expanded, revealing a best leaf value of 450. (c) The recursion unwinds and the 
best leaf value of the forgotten subtree (450) is backed up to Fagaras:  then Rimnicu  Vilcea is 
expanded. This time, because the best alternative path (through Timisoara) casts at least 447, 
the expansion continues to Bucharest. 
reexpanding the subtree at some later time. Figure 3.27 shows how RBFS  reaches Bucharest. 
REFS  is somewhat more efficient than WA",  but still suffers from excessive node re- 
generation. In the example in Figure 3.27, RBFS follows the path via Rimnicu  Vilcea, then
