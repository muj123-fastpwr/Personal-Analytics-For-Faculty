3.1 Asymptotic notation 51
f .n/
lim D 0: (3.1)
n!1
g.n/
Some authors use this limit as a de?nition of the o-notation; the de?nition in this
book also restricts the anonymous functions to be asymptotically nonnegative.
!-notation
By analogy, !-notation is to null -notation as o-notation is to O-notation. We use
!-notation to denote a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight. One way to
de?ne it is by
f .n/2 !.g.n// if and only if g.n/2 o.f .n// :
Formally, however, we de?ne !.g.n// (“little-omega of g of n”) as the set
!.g.n//Dff .n/W for any positive constantc>0 , there exists a constant
n >0such that 0nullcg.n/ < f .n/ for all nnullng :
0 0
2 2 2
For example, n =2D !.n/,butn =2¤ !.n /. The relation f .n/D !.g.n//
implies that
f .n/
lim D1;
n!1
g.n/
if the limit exists. That is, f .n/ becomes arbitrarily large relative to g.n/ as n
approaches in?nity.
Comparingfunctions
Many of the relational properties of real numbers apply to asymptotic comparisons
as well. For the following, assume that f .n/ and g.n/ are asymptotically positive.
Transitivity:
f .n/D ‚.g.n// and g.n/D ‚.h.n// imply f .n/D ‚.h.n// ;
f .n/D O.g.n// and g.n/D O.h.n// imply f .n/D O.h.n// ;
f .n/D null.g.n// and g.n/D null.h.n// imply f .n/D null.h.n// ;
f .n/D o.g.n// and g.n/D o.h.n// imply f .n/D o.h.n// ;
f .n/D !.g.n// and g.n/D !.h.n// imply f .n/D !.h.n// :
Re?exivity:
f .n/ D ‚.f .n// ;
f .n/ D O.f .n// ;
f .n/ D null.f .n// :
