EXAMPLE 14-2
Consider the following statements:
int *p;
int x;
Suppose that we have the memory allocation for p and x as shown in Figure 14-2.

1400 1750
p x
FIGURE 14-2 Main memory, p, and x
The values of &p, p, *p, &x, and x are as follows:
&p 1400 p ? (unknown) *p Does not exist &x 1750 x ? (unknown)
(undefined)
Suppose that the following statements are executed in the order given:
x = 50;
p = &x;
*p = 38;
The values of &p, p, *p, &x, and x are shown after each of these statements executes.
After the statement x = 50; executes, the values of &p, p, *p, &x, and x are as follows:
&p 1400 p ? (unknown) *p Does not exist &x 1750 x 50
(undefined)
After the statement p = &x; executes, the values of &p, p, *p, &x, and x are as follows:
&p 1400 p 1750 *p 50 &x 1750 x 50
After the statement *p = 38; executes, the values of &p, p, *p, &x, and x are as follows.
(Because *p and x refer to the same memory space, the value of x is also changed to 38.)
&p 1400 p 1750 *p 38 &x 1750 x 38
