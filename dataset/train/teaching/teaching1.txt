the command "Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it in the box." 
The most famous mieroworld  was the blocks world, which consists of a set of solid blocks 
placed on a tabletop (or more often, a simulation of a tabletop), as shown in Figure 1.4. 
A typical task in this world is to rearrange the blocks in a certain way, using a robot hand 
that can pick up one block at a time. The blocks world was home to the vision project of 
David Huffman (1971), the vision and constraint-propagation work of David Waltz (1975). 
the learning theory of Patrick Winston (1970), the natural-language-understanding program 
of Terry Winograd (1972), and the planner of Scott Fahlman  (1974). 
Early work building on the neural networks of McCulloch and Pitts also flourished. 
The work of Winograd and Cowan (1963) showed how a large number of elements could 
collectively represent an individual concept, with a corresponding increase in robustness and 
parallelism. Hebb's learning methods were enhanced by Bernie Widrow (Widrow and Hoff. 
1960; Widrow,  1962), who called his networks adalines.  and by Frank Rosenblatt (1962) 
with his perceptrons. The perceptron convergence theorem (Block et a1., 1962) says that 
the learning algorithm can adjust the connection strengths of a perceptron to match any input 
data, provided such a match exists. These topics are covered in Chapter 20. 
1.3.4 A dose of reality (1966-1973) 
From the beginning, Al   researchers were not shy about making predictions of their coming 
successes. The following statement by Herbert Simon in 1957 is often quoted: 
It is not my aim to surprise or shock you butthe simplest way I can summarize is  to say 
that there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and that create. Moreover,
