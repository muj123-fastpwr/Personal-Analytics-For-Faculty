Abstract
Rough set theory and game theory provide two approaches for analyzing and as-
sisting decision making. Rough set theory provides the ability to make decisions with
incomplete and insu?cient information. On the other hand, game theory concerns
with decision making where an outcome depends on interaction between two or more
decision making criteria. A fundamental challenge in the application of rough sets
is how to reduce the uncertain boundary region by con?guring the parameters or
thresholds de?ning the region bounds. The game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model
provides a game-theoretic perspective for setting and computing these thresholds.
Theconventionalroughsetmodelinroughsettheoryisintoleranttoclassi?cation
errors in the positive and negative regions which limit its practical applicability. The
probabilisticroughsetsallowforsomedegreeoferrorsinordertoincludemoreobjects
in the positive and negative regions, thereby improving the applicability or general-
ity. A pair of thresholds control the tradeo? between accuracy and generality. The
estimation or computation of thresholds is one of the major issues in the probabilistic
rough sets. The GTRS model aims to estimate balanced and optimized thresholds
when contradictive measures are present. This dissertation further explores di?erent
aspects of the GTRS model by focusing on two issues of probabilistic rough sets,
namely, the determination and interpretation of thresholds, and the application or
i
utilization of decision regions based on the thresholds to assist in decision making.
The ?rst issue has two parts, i.e., the determination of thresholds and the inter-
pretation of thresholds. The determination of thresholds is examined by setting up
games for trading-o? between di?erent criteria employed for evaluating rough sets.
The GTRS model aims to provide a tradeo? solution that can be used to obtain cost
e?ective thresholds in the game environment. In particular, we introduce and exam-
ine two games including a game for determining a balance between uncertainties of
the probabilistic rough set regions and another game for obtaining a tradeo? between
the properties of accuracy and generality.
The interpretation of thresholds is addressed by exploring the relationship be-
tween equilibria or game solutions and the determined thresholds. According to the
proposed interpretation, an equilibrium is de?ned in terms of a pair of thresholds
such that no player has any unilateral incentive to change these thresholds within
the game. The relationship between di?erent game constructs and the thresholds are
also explained.
Thesecondissueistheutilizationofdecisionregionstoassistandsupportdecision
making. In particular, the estimated thresholds with GTRS can be used to obtain
the three rough set regions which are utilized in applications for providing decision
support in the form of three-way decision rules. We provide an extensive study of
two applications, i.e., Web-based medical decision support systems and recommender
systems, where the use of GTRS based thresholds can be useful for supporting and
assisting in decision making.
It is hoped that the research in this dissertation would lead to a better under-
standing of the GTRS model thereby improving its future usability and applications.

Introduction
1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation
Rough set theory, emerged in the early 1980s, is an important and useful mathe-
matical approach to handle vague and imperfect knowledge [84, 90]. It can e?ectively
process uncertain, incomplete and insu?cient information to make useful inferences
and reasonings [85]. The conventional Pawlak model in rough set theory is of qual-
itative nature [143]. This is because the basic rough set notions of lower and upper
approximations in the Pawlak model represent qualitative relationship between an
equivalence class and a set. In particular, the lower approximation requires that an
equivalence class is contained in a set and the upper approximation requires that an
equivalence class has an overlap with a set [143]. The degree of an overlap is not
considered. This qualitative nature of the Pawlak model ensures that the positive
and negative regions are error free [140, 145, 152]. Researchers argued that the qual-
itative absoluteness and intolerance to errors can lead to problems and limitations in
practical applications [129, 145, 155].
ProbabilisticroughsetsareanimportantextensionofthePawlakmodel[140,156].
1
As opposed to the qualitative nature of the Pawlak model, the probabilistic rough
sets are of quantitive nature. Speci?cally, they consider the degree of an overlap be-
tween an equivalence class and a set in the form of conditional probability [140, 143].
Although the positive and negative regions in the probabilistic rough sets are not
error free but these regions include more objects thereby improving the applicabil-
ity or generality. The tradeo? between the tolerance to errors and the generality
are controlled by a pair of thresholds ( ) [140, 143]. The commonly used prob-
abilistic rough set model was developed with the framework of decision-theoretic
rough set model (DTRS) by Yao et al. [139, 147, 148] which uni?es and generalizes
other existing models, including the 0.5-probabilistic rough set model by Pawlak et
al. [91] and the variable precision rough set model (VPRS) by Ziarko [65, 155, 156].
Other probabilistic models include the Baysain rough set model (BRS) by Slazek
and Ziarko [107, 108], the Game-theoretic rough set model (GTRS) by Yao and Her-
bert [57, 135] and the information-theoretic rough set model (ITRS) by Deng and
Yao [37, 39]. There are three important challenges or issues for any probabilistic
rough set model, namely, the determination and interpretation of the thresholds, es-
timation of conditional probability (the probabilistic association between an object
and a concept) and the application or utilization of the decision regions obtained
with the thresholds to assist in decision making and data analysis [37, 143, 153]. We
do not deal with the second issue, i.e., the estimating of conditional probability and
focus on the ?rst and the third issues in the context of the GTRS model.
The GTRS model determines the thresholds or region bounds based on a game
involving an often contradictive criteria (or measures) employed for evaluating rough
2
?,?
sets [57, 135]. The basic idea is to analyze and examine how the probabilistic thresh-
olds may change in order to improvethe performance of rough set classi?cation based
on di?erent criteria [135]. Compared to other probabilistic models, the GTRS model
provides at least two bene?ts. Firstly, it utilizes the idea of “let the data speak
itself” to obtain the thresholds based on the data, thereby minimizing user involve-
ment [51, 56]. Secondly, the game mechanism employed in GTRS allows for the
simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria for analyzing rough sets [57]. In this
dissertation, we further extend the model by exploring and investigating di?erent
issues of probabilistic rough sets with the model.
The ?rst issue or challenge of the probabilistic rough sets that we addressed has
two parts, i.e., the determination of thresholds and the interpretation of thresholds.
The determination of thresholds was addressed by examining further games with
GTRSinvolvingcon?ictingorcontradictorymeasures. Althoughdi?erentgameswith
GTRS were also previously developed, the aspect of being in con?ict or contradiction
was not being fully explored in these games. The exploration of further games with
GTRS enabled us to incorporate and take advantage from the capabilities of game
theory in analyzing and providing tradeo? solutions based on con?icting criteria.
We proposed two games in this dissertation for this purpose, including a game for
determining a balance between uncertainties of the probabilistic rough set regions
and another game for determining a tradeo? between the properties of accuracy and
generality.
The second part of the ?rst issue, i.e., the interpretation or explanation of thresh-
olds is important to provide the users with the justi?cation of the selected thresholds
and to explain the results of data analysis. Some important considerations and tasks
3
with respect to the GTRS in this context are, connecting and attaching meanings to
the game symbols and formulae, relating the internal game mechanism (such as the
payo? tables) employed by the model with the thresholds and explaining the com-
puted thresholds in terms of the game outcomes or solutions. We addressed these
issues by reviewing and de?ning the basic game components in the GTRS, namely,
the players, the strategies and the payo? or utility functions. The payo? tables are
explained as the evaluation of di?erent thresholds (considered in the game) by the
players and the game solutions are interpreted in terms of the determined thresholds.
The second issue in the probabilistic rough sets, i.e., the usage and explanation of
thedecisionregionsisimportanttoknowthepotentialbene?tsandadvantagesofthe
determined thresholds in real applications. In particular, the thresholds (computed
withGTRS)canbeusedtoobtain thepositive, negativeand boundary regionswhich
are used to induce ternary or three-way decisions in the form of acceptance, rejection
and deferment decisions [141]. The importance of GTRS based three-way decisions
is that they are based on a tradeo? solution between multiple in?uential and critical
factor of decision making such as risk, uncertainty, cost and accuracy and therefore
leads to moderate and cost e?ective levels of acceptance, rejection and deferment
decisions. We empirically study the use of GTRS based thresholds in analyzing data
for making useful inferences and decisions in two applications, namely, Web-based
medical decision support systems and recommender systems. Three-way decisions in
the medical ?eld are obtained with GTRS by balancing the uncertainties of decision
regions. It is suggested that the GTRS can improve the overall uncertainty of de-
cision regions thereby providing useful decision support. In recommender systems,
the GTRS is used to determine a tradeo? between the properties of accuracy and
4
generality in order to assist in ternary recommendations.
1.2 Contributions of the Thesis
The material presented in this thesis is the result of research on game-theoretic
roughset(GTRS)model[13,17]anditsinvestigationtodeterminee?ectivethresholds
based on a tradeo? solution [8, 10, 11, 14]. The determined thresholds are used to
induce GTRS based ternary or three-way decisions [6] to provide decision support in
Web-based decision support systems [132, 133] and recommender systems [15, 16].
The work includes possible solutions to the fundamental problems and issues in the
probabilistic rough sets that are related to the determination and interpretation of
thresholdsandtheuseofdecisionregionstoobtainGTRSbasedternaryorthree-way
decisions in two applications. The main contributions of the thesis are summarized
below.
Interpretation of Equilibria in the GTRS Model
InexistingstudiesonGTRS,therewasasemanticgapanddi?cultyinexpressing
thegamesolutions(basedonatradeo?)intermsofthedeterminedthresholds[17,57].
Although the game solution is used to determine the thresholds, it is not very clear
as to how they are related to the thresholds within the game. To bridge this semantic
gap, we provided an interpretation of equilibria in the GTRS after reviewing and
de?ning the basic game constructs. According to the proposed interpretation, any
game solution or an equilibrium is interpreted as a strategy pro?le such that for
the corresponding threshold pair no player has any incentive to deviate from these
thresholds within the game. A general two-player game in GTRS is also de?ned.
5
Another related issue was that it was not very clear whether a game solution always
exists [17]. This issue was addressed by considering a couple of typical two-player
games in GTRS. These games are analyzed to investigate the presence of dominant
strategies for players. The results suggest that the existence of equilibria may be
established under certain limited conditions.
An Approach for Analyzing Uncertainties in the Probabilistic Rough Set
Regions with GTRS
The probabilistic positive, negative and boundary regions are associated with
di?erent levels of uncertainty. We approach the determination of thresholds from
the viewpoint of tradeo? between the uncertainties of di?erent regions. A two player
gameinGTRSisintroducedwherethepositiveandnegativedecisionregionscompete
againsttheboundaryregion. Thegameconsidersdi?erentthresholdcon?gurationsin
order to ?nd an acceptable solution agreed by the two players. By repeatedly playing
the game several times and utilizing its results for updating the thresholds, a GTRS
based learning mechanism is proposed that automatically tunes the thresholds based
on the data itself.
Examination of GTRS based Thresholds for Three-way Decisions
The concept of three-way decisions was recently incorporated in the rough set
theory by providing an alternative interpretation of the three rough set regions [141].
In particular, the positive, negative and boundary regions may be used to induce
rulesforobtainingdecisionsofacceptance,rejectionanddeferment,respectively[141].

Buildinganddevelopingontheseideas,weexamineGTRSbasedthresholdsforthree-
way decisions. As an example, we study the use of GTRS based three-way decisions
in medical treatment and diagnosis decisions.
Application of GTRS in Recommender Systems
Recommender systems is also used as a real world application to show the useful-
ness of GTRS. The properties of accuracy and generality of recommendations play
a key role in building an e?ective recommender systems. Making highly accurate

Background
2.1 Rough Sets
Rough set theory is mathematical tool to analyze data characterized by uncertain
and incomplete information [84, 85]. An important realization in the theory is that
sets (concepts) can only be described roughly using approximations consisting of
objects having the properties of certainly, possibly or certainly not belonging to a
set[40]. Thisismostusefulindiscoveringdecisionrules,?ndingimportantattributes,
reducing the data and analyzing con?icts [98, 100, 106, 120, 149]. We brie?y review
theconventionalPawlakroughsetmodelandsomeofitsprobabilisticextensionsthat
are relevant to this thesis.
2.1.1 Pawlak Rough Sets
The Pawlak rough set model make use of an information table where a ?nite set
of objects are described by a ?nite set of attributes [85]. An information table S may
be de?ned as a tuple [150]
9
S = (UAt, V a At I a At )
a a
where U is a ?nite nonempty set of objects known as the universe, At is a set of
attributeswhichisnonemptybut?nite, V isanonemptysetofvaluesforanattribute
a
a At and I is an information function that maps U V . The information
a a
function I maps an object x U to a value in V , i.e. I (x) Va.
a a a
A major concern in rough set theory is discerning objects from one another. The
equivalence relation may be used for this purpose. An equivalence relation based on
a set of attributes A At can be de?ned as,
E = (x,y ) U U a A,I (x) =I (y) (2.1)
A a a
where E is known as an equivalence relation with respect to an attribute set A. The
A
above de?nition means that two objects x andy inU are equivalent or in other words
indiscernible by the attribute set A At if and only if they share the same values on
all attributes in A.
TheequivalencerelationinducesapartitionoftheuniverseU,denotedbyU/E [153].
ThesubsetsinU/E areknownasequivalenceclasses. Anequivalenceclasscontaining
object x is given by [x] = y U xEy . The Pawlak’s rough set approximations are
based on these equivalence classes. Considering a subset C U, the lower and upper
approximations of C are de?ned as [84, 85],
apr(C) = x U [x] C (2.2)
apr(C) = x U [x] C = (2.3)
10
,}???|?{,}?|?{?}|?{?,}?|?×?{??????,}?|{,}?|{,
According to the lower and upper approximations, the positive, negative and bound-
ary regions of a concept C are de?ned as [85, 142],
POS(C) = apr(C)
= x U [x] C (2.4)
c
NEG(C) = (apr(C))
= x U [x] C = (2.5)
BND(C) = apr(C) apr(C)
= x U [x] C [x] C = (2.6)
The conditions in Equations (2.2) - (2.3), i.e., [x] C and [x] C = , are high-
lighting the qualitative relationships between an equivalence class [x] and a concept
C. Speci?cally, the condition [ x] C re?ects whether [ x] is fully contained in C, i.e.,
[x] has a perfect overlap with C and the condition [x] C = highlights whether [x]
has some overlap with C. The degree of an overlap is not considered.
The lack of being not considerate to the degree of an overlap between an equiva-
lence class and a set leads to strict conditions for the positive and negative regions.
In particular, the conditions in Equations (2.4) - (2.6) suggest that all the objects in
the positive region are de?nitely contained in C and all the objects in the negative
region are de?nitely not contained in C. The objects in the boundary region may be
contained in C. The requirements for inclusion in the positive and negative regions
may be to strict to be practically useful in real applications [128, 129]. A major issue
inroughsetsbaseddataanalysisisthereforetorelaxtheserequirementsforincluding
more objects in the positive and negative regions [140]. The probabilistic rough set
11

models provide a solution to this problem.
2.1.2 Probabilistic Rough Sets
A major change in the probabilistic rough sets is the consideration of a degree of
an overlap between an equivalence class [x] and a set C in the form of conditional
probability de?ned as,
C [x]
P(C [x]) = (2.7)
[x]
Now instead of requiring an equivalence class to be completely or not completely in
set C, the degree of an overlap between [x] and C, i.e., P(C [x]) is used to decide the
inclusion of [x] in a certain region.
We now brie?y review the main results of probabilistic rough sets [33, 140, 143].
The lower and upper approximations of a concept C are de?ned by using a threshold
pair ( ) (with 0 < 1) as follows:
apr (C) = x U P(C [x]
( ;  )
= [x] U/E P(C [x]) (2.8)
apr (C) = x U P(C [x]>
( ;  )
= [x] U/E P(C [x])> (2.9)
The ( )-probabilistic positive, negative and boundary regions can be de?ned
12

based on ( )-lower and upper approximations, which are also named as probabilis-
tic three-way decision model [142, 144]:

BND (C) =apr (C) apr (C)
( ;  )
( ;  )
( ;  )
= x U <P (C [x])< (2.12)
The conditional probability may be recognized as a level of con?dence that an
object having the same description as x belongs to C. For an object y having the
same description as x, we accept it to be in C if the con?dence level is greater than
or equal to level , i.e. P(C [x]) . The same object y may be rejected to be in
C if the con?dence level is lesser than or equal to level , i.e. P(C [x]) . The
decision about object y to be in C may be deferred if the con?dence is between the
two levels, i.e. <P (C [x])< .
Onecande?nethePawlaklowerandupperapproximationsusingtheprobabilistic
rough set model by considering the equivalent form of conditions in Equations (2.2)
and (2.3) in terms of conditional probability. The condition [x] C is equivalent to
P(C [x]) = 1 and the condition [x] C = is equivalent to P(C [x])> 0. This leads
13
|???|??|???|???|?.}?|?|?{?,}??||?{?,}??||?{?,?
to the following de?nitions [143],
apr (C) = x U P(C [x]) 1 (2.13)
(1;0)
apr (C) = x U P(C [x])> 0 (2.14)
(1;0)
where P(C [x]) 1 is used instead of P(C [x]) = 0 for having consistency in format.
Based on Equations (2.13) and (2.14), the Pawlak positive, negative and boundary
regions based are de?ned as [143],
POS (C) = x U P(C [x]) 1 (2.15)
(1;0)
NEG (C) = x U P(C [x]) 0 (2.16)
(1;0)
BND (C) = x U 0<P(C [x])< 1 (2.17)
(1;0)
ThismeansthatthePawlakmodelisaspecialcaseoftheprobabilisticroughsetmodel
with( ) = (1 0). Equations(2.15)-(2.17)suggestthatthePawlakmodelrequires
P(C [x]) to be strictly one or zero for considering an object x to be included in either
positive or negative regions. The probabilistic approach relaxes these conditions by
introducing thresholds ( ).
2.1.3 Review of the Probabilistic Rough Set Models
Thekeyresultsofthebasicmodelofprobabilisticroughsets(discussedinthepre-
vious section) were ?rst proposed by Yao et al. [147, 148] in decision-theoretic rough
set model (DTRS) [146]. The importance of DTRS model is that it covers all speci?c
14
?,?|,?,?.}||?{,}?||?{,}?||?{|?|,}||?{,}?||?{
models introduced before it [146]. It is however important to note that the interpre-
tation of the Pawlak model in terms of conditional probability, i.e, characterized by
( ) = (1 0) was introduced by Wong and Ziarko [123] and the 0.5-probabilistic
rough set model characterized by ( ) = (0 5 0 5) was introduced by Wong and
Ziarko [121] and Pawlak et al. [91]. In this model, the positive, negative and bound-
ary regions are de?ned based on probability greater than 0.5, lesser than 0 .5 and
equal to 0.5, respectively. Wong and Ziarko also introduced another model that was
characterized by > 0 5 and = 0 5 in [122]. We now brie?y review some of the
widely used and important the probabilistic rough set models.
The0.5-probabilisticroughsetmodelthatwasputforwardbyWongandZiarko[121]
and Pawlak et al. [91]. It is essentially based on the majority rule. An object x is put
into the positive region of set C if majority of the objects in the equivalent class [x]
are in C. This is determined by using the conditional probability P(C [x]) which is
referredtoasroughmembershipfunctionbyPawlakandSkowron[88]. Theboundary
region in this model consists of all objects whose corresponding equivalence classes
have conditional probabilities equal to 0.5. There are two main limitations of this
model. Firstly, the the use of restricted and ?xed thresholds, does not provide any
?exibility to further improve and obtain more e?ective models [145]. Secondly, by
?xing the thresholds, the interpretation and computation of thresholds are ignored
which leads to practical di?culties when applying probabilistic rough sets [145].
The decision-theoretic rough set model or DTRS is one of the most important
and widely used probabilistic model proposed by Yao et al. [139, 147, 148]. It uses
the cost of classifying an object either correctly or incorrectly to determine di?erent
regions [51]. In particular, the Bayesian decision approach is used for minimum
15
|.?.?.,.?,?,?,?
risk decision making based on the loss functions associated with di?erent actions of
classi?cation decisions. Recently, Yao argued that the DTRS model can be used
to answer two semantic issue in the probabilistic rough sets, i.e., the determination
and interpretation of thresholds on probabilities and the interpretation of the rules
obtained from the positive, negative and boundary regions [143]. Yao further argued
that one can express and obtain other probabilistic models by considering special
conditionsonthelossfunctionswithintheDTRSframework[139]. Thecostfunctions
intheDTRSaregenerallyexpectedfromuserswhicharesometimeshardtodetermine
especially when there is lack of preliminary knowledge [63]. This means that users
involvementisneededforcomputingthethresholdsalthoughindirectly(forproviding
the values for the loss functions) [51, 62].
The variable precision rough set model was introduced by Ziarko [155]. It uses
bounds on a function that measures the relative degree of misclassi?cation to obtain
the rough sets approximations [155]. More recently, the model was also interpreted
based on a lower bound l and an upper bound u on the conditional probability
between an equivalence class and a concept [156]. The (lu ) bounds or thresholds are
expected to be provided by the users or experts. Although an expert may draw from
his experience some values for (lu ) thresholds, it may be very di?cult to provide
any scienti?c evidence in support of their selection. This means that an expert may
use his intuition to con?gure the model for use on the data set [51]. In case the
thresholds does not lead to acceptable results, one may need to perform several trails
before suitable values of thresholds are obtained. How to obtain the thresholds based
on the data itself is a major challenge in this context.
The information-theoretic rough set model was recently proposed by Deng and
16
,,
Yao [37]. It uses the measure of Shanon entropy to de?ne the uncertainty associated
with the probabilistic regions. The determination of thresholds is approached as the
minimization of the overall uncertainty of the probabilistic regions. However, the
model does not provide an explicit mechanism for searching or learning an optimal
threshold pairs in the space of possible threshold pairs. To overcome this di?culty,
a gradient descent and genetic algorithm based approaches were combined with the
ITRS model in [39] and [75], respectively.
2.1.4 Review of the Game-theoretic Rough Set Model
The game-theoretic rough set model or GTRS was introduced by Yao and Her-
bert [57, 135]. The model was used to analyze the classi?cation ability in the DTRS
framework by implementing a game between classi?cation measures. By modify-
ing the risks associated with di?erent classi?cation decisions, the thresholds were
con?gured based on the resulting classi?cation quality. Two measures, i.e., accu-
racy and precision, are particularly being focused. The two measures are de?ned
as [14, 135, 140],

The regions were allowed to directly change the thresholds in order to improve their
respective sizes. The importance of this model is that it resolved one of the major
di?culties with existing probabilistic models, i.e., the determination of thresholds
17
.||?,?,|?||???|?,?
based on the data itself thereby minimizing user involvement [51, 56].
A review of the earlier studies suggests that the GTRS is primarily studied in
the context of the DTRS model [55, 53, 57, 56, 135]. This unnecessarily leads to an
impression for its limited usage only under the DTRS model. By investigating other
game formulations in GTRS, we argue that the GTRS is capable of determining the
thresholds independent of the DTRS framework. In other words, it should be treated
as a separate branch, not under the umbrella of DTRS research. This opens new
research avenues for exploring the GTRS model.
The GTRS is a probabilistic rough set model. A probabilistic rough set model
should address at least the following three fundamental issues [37, 143, 153].
The determination and interpretation of thresholds,
Estimation of conditional probability,
The interpretation and applications of the three regions in data analysis.
The focus in this dissertation is on the ?rst and the third issue. The determination
aspect is further explored by considering di?erent games for analyzing rough sets
using di?erent measures. A game for analyzing uncertainties of decision regions is
consideredinChapter4andagamebetweenthepropertiesofaccuracyandgenerality
of rough set based decision making is considered in Chapter 5. The interpretation
issue is considered in Chapter 3 by interpreting and relating a game solution to
the computed thresholds. In Chapter 5 and 6, the third issue will be addressed by
considering the applications of three-way decisions with GTRS.
For the sake of being complete, we review the basic concepts in game theory that
are relevant to this thesis.

2.2 Game Theory
Game theory remains as an interesting subject for analyzing situations of con?ict
or cooperation among multiple agents considered in an interactive environment [80,
116]. In decision making and analysis, game theory is useful for investigating possible
consequencesthatmayresultbyconsideringdi?erentchoicesorpreferencesforsolving
a problem. Eventually, one may determine the possible actions that an entity or
criteriashouldundertakeforachievingacertainpositionobservedwithgametheoretic
formulation. Computer scientists have utilized games to model problems in many
areas such as machine learning, computer networks, cryptography and rough sets [7,
21, 41, 52, 57].

2 2
Let us look at a classical example in game theory: the prisoner’s dilemma. The
game consists of two players, i.e. P = p p . Each player is a suspect of a crime
1 2
and is arrested by police. The police have insu?cient evidence for conviction. During
interrogation by police, each prisoner have a choice of either to confess, thus impli-
cating the other prisoner for the crime, or not to confess to the crime. This suggests
two strategies or actions for each player, i.e., confess and don’t confess. The strategy
set in this case is given by S = s s , where s represents the strategy of confess
1 2 1
19
},{},{
while s the strategy of don’t confess. The payo?s or utilities of the players corre-
2
sponding to di?erent strategies are represented by the respective jail time a prisoner
may receive. Table 2.1 represents the payo?s or utilities of the players corresponding
to di?erent strategies.
If prisoner p confesses to the crime thereby implicating the other, he will serve
1
either a maximum jail term of 10 years or will be set free, depending on the strategy
of prisoner p . Similarly, if p chooses not to confess, he will serve either a minimum
2 1
of 1 year or a maximum of 20 years of jail term depending on his opponent chosen
strategy. When both players chooses to confess, they will each receive 10 years of
jail term. In case when none of the prisoners is confessing, they both serve 1 year.
Obviously, without knowing the opponent’s strategy, a rational player would choose
to confess, as it provides the smallest maximum jail term as well as the smallest
overall term.
The above example expresses the strength of game theory in analyzing complex
situations involving multiple entities. Game-theoretic analysis may provide a fresh
perspective for analyzing decision making problems in rough sets involving multiple
criteria. The game-theoretic rough set model or GTRS is a recent forward move in
thisdirection. In particular, the GTRS aims at utilizing the strengths of gametheory
and rough sets for analyzing decision making involving multiple criteria.
In the remainder of this section, we review the basic concepts of game theory
which are necessary and useful in understanding the GTRS model.
20
2.2.1 Game Types
Game theory can be classi?ed into two branches termed as noncooperative games
and cooperative games. The term noncooperative games can be misleading in the
sense that it could mean that it only deals with situations where the interests of the
players are in con?ict. This is not true although one may argue that the noncoop-
erative games are more interesting in such situations. In the same way, the term
cooperative games can also be misleading in the sense that it may refer to only those
situations where the agents’ interests are in conformity with each other. The exact
and main di?erence between these two branches is the way the games are being mod-
elled or formulated. Speci?cally, in noncooperative game theory the basic modelling
unit is a single player along with his personal beliefs and preferences. On the other
hand in cooperative game theory (also sometimes known as coalition game theory)
the basic modelling unit is the group of players.
Thereareotherpossibleclassi?cationofgamesthatonemay?ndintheliterature.
For instance, the consideration of game process would lead to classi?cation of static
games, dynamicgamesandrepeatedgames. Therealizationofcertaintypesofpayo?
functions would lead to the classi?cation of zero sum games and non-zero sum games.
Based on the strategies in the game one may classify the games as symmetric or
non-symmetric games. Sequential games and simultaneous games are based on the
timing of players move. Any problem that is formulated as a game can be included
into one or more of these classes.
21
2.2.2 Representing Games
The games are generally represented in either extensive form or normal form. In
the prisoner’s dilemma example, the players selected their strategies simultaneously.
There was no involvement of the notion of sequence or time at which the players can
perform their actions. The extensive form of games allows for representing the tem-
poral structure in the game [70]. Speci?cally, this form makes the order in which the
playermoveexplicitandwhateachplayerknowwhenmakingaparticularmove. The
extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a decision tree [44].
The normal form which is also sometimes called as strategic form is the most
familiar and fundamental representation in game theory [70]. It is argued that many
game representations can be reduced to this form [44, 70]. A normal form game may
can be mathematically expressed as a tuple (PSu ), where:
P is a ?nite set of n players,
S =S S , where S is a ?nite set of strategies available to player i. Each
1 n i
s = (s s s ) S is called a strategy pro?le where player i plays strategy
1 2 n
s . A strategy pro?le contains exactly one strategy for each of the n players.
i
u = (u u ) where u :S is a real-valued utility or payo? function for
1 n i
player i.
A normal form game is generally expressed using tables called payo? tables. Ta-
ble 2.1 is a typical example of such representation (i.e., the payo? tables). For a
two player game, the rows in front of player 1 or p (i.e., rows covered by player 1
1
which speci?cally are rows 3 and 4 in the table) of the payo? table correspond to the
22
??null...,,•?...,,,×...×••,,
strategiesavailabletoplayer1andthecolumnsundertheplayer2or p (i.e., columns
2
covered by player 2 which speci?cally are columns 3 and 4 in the table) correspond to
the strategies of player 2. Each cell of the table corresponds to a particular strategy
pro?le which is speci?ed by the strategies of the players. For instance, the cell in the
top right corner of Table 2.1 corresponds to the strategy pro?le ( s s ) = (confess,
1 1
confess). Thisrepresentsagamesituationinwhichboththeplayersdecidetoconfess.
Every cell of the payo? table contains a pair of values, called payo?s or utilities of the
playersthatarebasedonthestrategypro?lecorrespondingtothatcell. Forinstance,
the cell in the top right corner of Table 2.1 contains (10,10) which is based on the
strategy pro?le ( s s ). The payo?s represent the possible bene?ts a player may get
1 1
in selecting a certain strategy and are determined using a player’s respective payo?
function. The purpose or objective in a game is to select a particular strategy pro?le
as a game solution (which is also sometimes called as a game outcome). Generally
speaking, the game solution represents a balanced and optimum position between the
players.
2.2.3 Dominant Strategies and Equilibria
In the prisoners dilemma example discussed in the previous section, the two pris-
oners face a situation that is known as dominant strategies. For an individual player,
a dominant strategy is a strategy that provides a better payo? irrespective of the
opponents choosen strategy. In the prisoner’s dilemma example, confess is the domi-
nant strategy for both players as it provide the minimum jail time for each prisoner
irrespective of its opponent strategy. We introduce some de?nitions that will lead us
to the de?nition of dominant strategy.
23
,,
Let s s S andS bethesetofallpossiblestrategypro?lesoftheremaining
i i i i
players, then s will strictly dominates s if [70],
i i
s S we have u (s s )>u (s s ) (s =s ) (2.20)
i i i i i i i i i i
This means that strategy s provides better payo? than s for player i irrespective of
i i
what other players are doing.
Let s s S andS bethesetofallpossiblestrategypro?lesoftheremaining
i i i i
payers, then s will weakly dominates s if [70],
i i
s S we have u (s s ) u (s s ) (s =s ) and
i i i i i i i i i i
s S such that u (s s )>u (s s ) (s =s ) (2.21)
i i i i i i i i i i
This suggests that s is weakly dominant if it always provide atleast as good payo?
i
as any other strategy, for any pro?le of other player’s strategy and is strictly better
for some pro?le of other’s strategies.
A strategy is considered to be strictly or weakly dominant for a player if it strictly
or weakly dominates any other strategy for that player [70]. If every player in a game
has a dominant strategy, then the equilibrium or game solution in that game is called
dominant strategy equilibrium.
The strategy pro?le ( s s s ) in which every s is a dominant strategy of
1 2 n i
player i (irrespective of s being strictly or weakly dominant) is known as dominant
i
strategy equilibrium [70].

2.2.4 Nash Equilibrium
The solution concept of Nash equilibrium is adopted in this thesis which is com-
monly used in the GTRS model [10, 14]. We need to de?ne some terminologies and
notations for introducing the concept of Nash equilibrium.
Let s = (s s s s s ) be a strategy pro?le without ith player strat-
i 1 2 i 1 i+1 n
egy, we may write s = (s s s ) = (s s ). This means that all the players
1 2 n i i
expect i are playing s while player i choose s . Sometimes we will refer to the set
i i
of all strategy pro?les other then player i as S .
i
Considering a situation where the opponents of i, (denoted as i) were to commit
to play s . The problem player i would face is to determine his best response given
i
its opponents are playing s .
i
For a particular player i, s S is the best response to the strategy pro?le
i i
s S if,
i i
s S , we have u (s s ) u (s s ) (s =s ) (2.22)
i i i i i i i
i i i
The best response of a player maximizes a player’s payo? given its opponents chosen
strategy. The best response of a player may not be necessarily unique. The above
de?nition forms the basis for de?ning the Nash equilibrium.
A strategy pro?le ( s s s ) is a Nash equilibrium, if for all players i, s is the
1 2 n i
best response to s . This can be equivalently represented in mathematical form as,
i
i s S u (s s ) u (s s ) where (s =s ) (2.23)
i i i i i i i
i i i
25
??,?,???,,??????...,,,??,?,???,?????????????,...,,,...,,,?...,,,?
Intuitively, the Nash equilibrium is a strategy pro?le such that no player can
achieve a higher payo? if he knew about the strategies, other players are following.
In other words, it is a stable strategy pro?le in the sense that no player would want
to change his strategy unless the other players are willing to change their strategies.

just to mention some causes. Intelligent decision making is an interdisciplinary re-
search where one of the primary concerns is to develop models for obtaining e?ective
decisions [113, 125]. Two commonly encountered issues in these models are the pres-
ence of too many yet potentially useful choices or alternatives and the involvement
of con?icting or contradictory criteria for evaluating possible decisions [89, 126]. The
game-theoreticrough set(GTRS) modelis a recent alternative for intelligent decision
making that meet these challenges and issues by taking advantage from rough sets
based data analysis coupled with game-theoretic decision analysis [84, 86, 117, 135].
An important contribution of GTRS is that it provides a mechanism for deter-
mining a pair of thresholds that are used in the probabilistic rough set model to
27
induce three-way decisions [57]. Given a certain hypothesis and a pair of thresh-
olds ( ), if the probability of a hypothesis is above an upper threshold we accept
the hypothesis; if it is below a lower threshold we reject the hypothesis; if it is
between the two thresholds we choose a third decision called non-commitment, de-
ferment or uncertain decision [60, 72]. One can expect more deferred decisions in
the presence of uncertain information. The pair of thresholds provides a tradeo? be-
tween certain versus deferred decisions based on the quality of available information.
A fundamental problem in this context is the interpretation and determination of
probabilistic thresholds [143]. Some notable attempts in this regard include decision-
theoretic, game-theoretic, information-theoretic, optimization based and risk based
approaches [10, 37, 63, 71, 73, 139].
It is worth mentioning that Yao and Deng recently presented a framework of
quantitative rough sets based on subsethood or set inclusion measures [145]. The
framework provides a platform to unify the study of some of the existing generaliza-
tionsoftheroughsetmodels. Despitehavingdi?erentformulationofthequantitative
rough sets, the rough set approximations and the three regions are still de?ned by a
pair of thresholds on subsethood measures. The determination of thresholds remains
as a challenge in the new framework.
The equilibria play a critical role in determining thresholds in the GTRS model.
Although the existing studies demonstrate the usefulness of GTRS in determining
the thresholds, there is still a semantic gap in relating the possible game solutions
with the computed or determined thresholds [17, 135]. In other words, it may not
be very clear as to how to express and relate the game solution to the determined
thresholds [17]. This leads to the issue of interpretation of equilibria in the GTRS
28
?,?
model. The game solutions are used in GTRS to determine the thresholds. Although
it was possible with existing games in GTRS to determine the thresholds based on
the game solutions, however, it may not be clear whether a game solution always
exists. In other words, we are not able to rule out the possibility of having no game
solution. This leads to the issue of establishment of equilibria in the GTRS model.
In this chapter, we focus on these two issues.
To address the meaning of equilibria, we ?rst de?ned and provided interpretation
of the basic game components in a two-player game, including the players, strate-
gies and strategy pro?les in GTRS. The strategies are de?ned as representing possi-
ble changes or modi?cations in the thresholds and the strategy pro?les as di?erent
threshold pairs representing various probabilistic rough set models. Based on these
descriptions, an equilibrium is interpreted as a strategy pro?le such that for the cor-
responding thresholds, no player has any incentive or gain to change these thresholds
within the game. The issue of the establishment of equilibria is addressed by consid-
eringacoupleoftypicaltwo-playergamesinGTRS.Itissuggestedthattheexistence
of equilibria may be established under certain limited conditions.

twofold: ?rstly, it will help in improving the current understandability of the model
and secondly, it will lead to a better awareness about the theory, its limitations and
appropriateness to di?erent real life problems. There are two major sections in this
chapter. Section 3.1 explains the basic game components and then address the issue
of interpretation of a game solution. Section 3.2 is on the issue of establishment of
equilibria.

3.1 Interpretation of Equilibria in GTRS
The analysis of equilibria help us in doing meaningful reasoning in games. Such
reasoning helps us to interpret possible consequences a particular player may en-
counter while selecting a certain course of action. We need to de?ne the basic game
components in order to be able to do such reasoning. For this purpose we de?ne
and interpret the major game components that forms the basis for de?ning a game
in GTRS. The issue of interpretation of equilibria is then addressed based on these
de?nitions.
3.1.1 Game Components in the GTRS
We mainly focus on three basic components, i.e., the players, strategies and the
strategy pro?les.
The Players
The main motivation of GTRS is to improve the quality of decision making (ob-
tained with rough sets based classi?cation). It is important to note that di?erent
applications may need to optimize di?erent decision making criteria such as the accu-
racy,e?ciencyorrobustnessassociatedwithdecisionmaking[10]. Suitableevaluation
measures may be selected to evaluate each of these criteria in the context of rough
sets based decision making. It is suggested that the threshold levels are con?gured in
order to improve some of the considered criteria [37].

?,??,??,?
based on the criteria c and c , respectively. It is sensible to select thresholds which
1 2
will optimize both c ( ) and c ( ). This however may not be possible in reality.
1 2
The con?guration of thresholds in order to improve or optimize one property or
criteria may come at a cost of decrease in some other properties.
The players in GTRS represent possible criteria that are employed for analyzing
rough sets. The consideration of di?erent players will result in di?erent thresholds
leading to di?erent probabilistic rough set models. The question of which players to
select depends on the objectives and expectation of users. For instance, if we wish to
improvetheclassi?cationabilitythenthemeasures,suchasaccuracy,precision,recall
or generality, may be realized as potential game players. Please be noted that in the
rest of this chapter, whenever we use the term player we mean a certain criterion.
Game Strategies
The strategies in GTRS are understood as related to di?erent qualities of the
three regions and the implied three-way decisions or classi?cation. Let Q ( ),
P
Q ( ) and Q ( ) denote some desired quality of the induced positive, negative
N B
and boundary regions, respectively. These quality measures are interpreted based on
the notions such as errors, bene?ts, risks or gains associated with the three regions.
For instance, in decision-theoretic rough sets [147, 139] they are interpreted as risks,
in information-theoretic rough sets [37] they are interpreted as uncertainties and in
the framework for calculating the total errors they are represented as classi?cation
errors [142].
The players in the game compete against each other by adjusting the quality
measures of the three regions. For instance, the accuracy may seek to improve the
31
?,??,??,??,??,?
quality measures related to the positive and negative regions in order to obtain an
accurate model. This will allow for the movement of some low quality objects to
the boundary region leading to better accuracy. On the other hand, a player such as
generalitymaywishtoallowadecreaseinthequalitymeasuresrelatedtothepositive
and negative regions. This will allow for the accommodation of more objects in these
regions. A pair of thresholds controls the tradeo? between the properties of accuracy
and generality in setting up a suitable quality levels for the regions.
Changing the quality requirement will e?ect the thresholds in some order. An al-
ternativewaytoformulatestrategiesistorealizedirectmodi?cationsinthethreshold
levels. In any case, a strategy will lead to a certain change in the thresholds ( ).

Considering strategy s of c , we associate the thresholds ( ) that will result in

by executing strategy s . In the same way, a particular strategy s of c will result

Pleasebe notedthatthesuperscriptswith( )thresholds arereferring to strategies
and the subscripts are referring to the players. The same semantics will be used in
the rest of this chapter.
It is possible that a particular strategy only modi?es a single threshold. For in-
stance, changing the uncertainty of the positive region will only require modi?cation
in threshold [14]. We can simplify the notation in Equation (3.1) in such cases. If
strategy s of player c only leads to modi?cation in threshold than the resulting
m 1
32
???,?.?,??,?,???,??,??,?
m
threshold pair will be denoted as ( ). This means that the strategy does not
1
modify the value. In the same way, if a strategy s of player c only leads to modi-
n 2
n
?cation in threshold than the resulting threshold pair will be denoted as ( ). A
2
change in only threshold based on strategies s and s of c and c are represented
m n 1 2
m n
as ( ) and ( ), respectively.
1 2
Strategy Pro?les
Thecombinationsofstrategiesinagameareinterpretedasstrategypro?les. Each
strategy pro?le represents a strategic situation between the players that arise during
the game. A strategy pro?le should include exactly one strategy for each player. The
strategy pro?le ( s s ), would mean that player c plays s and player c plays s .
m n 1 m 2 n
We now turn to the issue of representing the pro?le in terms of thresholds.
The existing GTRS based formulations suggest that each strategy pro?le should
alsoleadto(orcorrespondto)aparticularthresholdpair[14]. Consideringastrategy
mn mn
pro?le ( s s ), we denote the associated thresholds with this pro?les as ( ),
m n
i.e.,
mn mn
(s s ) ( ) (3.2)
m n
mn mn
An important issue here is how we obtain the thresholds ( ). It is clear
mn mn
and understandable that the thresholds ( ) are the result of executing the
strategies s and s simultaneously in the game. Moreover, from description of
m n
strategies in Section 3.1.1, we note that each strategy results in a threshold pair,
m m n n
i.e., strategy s of c leads to ( ) and strategy s of c leads to ( ). It
m 1 n 2
1 1 2 2
is reasonable to consider that the strategy pro?le which combines the two strategies
to create a game scenario should somehow incorporate the individual changes in
33
?,??,??,??,?.?,??,?,?,,?,??,???,????,?
thresholds suggested by each strategy belonging to that pro?le. We represent this
by introducing two functions. The function H is used for determining the values
corresponding to a strategy pro?le and the function O is used for for determining the
mn mn
values corresponding to a strategy pro?le. In particular, the thresholds ( )
are calculated as,
mn m n
= H( ) (3.3)
1 2
mn m n
= O( ) (3.4)
1 2
This means that the function H accepts the values corresponding to the strategies
m n
inthe pro?le( s s ), i.e., ( ) (please refer back to Equation (3.1)). In the same
m n
1 2
way, the function O accepts the values corresponding to strategies in the pro?le
m n
(s s ), i.e., ( ).

ThefunctionsH andO maycalculatethe( )thresholdsbasedonstatisti-

are computed based on the maximum operator as follow.

are a bit relax for including objects in the negative region (thresholds controls the

negative region). This may be a case when a false positive involves a higher cost
compared to false negative.

The purpose of GTRS is to evaluate all possible strategy pro?les in the game by
considering their respective thresholds and attempt to reach an optimal solution.
Table 3.1 summarizes the game-theoretic symbols and their meanings in the context
of GTRS.
In practice, the game may either return no solution, exactly one solution or mul-
tiple solutions. In case of no precise and clear solution, we may consider some soft
computing approaches for determining an approximate solution. On the other hand,
in case of multiple solutions, the techniques such as user preferences, application
requirements or the solution providing maximum payo?s for the players, can be con-
sidered. We restrict our discussion to the case of a single solution and leave the issues
related to no solution or multiple solutions for future research.
The question of which strategy pro?le constitute the game solution is of central

The selected threshold pair represents a level of compromise or tradeo? between
the players. The individual believes about the con?guration of thresholds are incor-
porated in calculating the output pair. Particularly, the selected threshold pair is
37
??,???,???,??,??,?,???,?,?,,?????,,??,,???,?,?,,,,•?,?,?,??,?
interpreted as a threshold pair such that any changes in the thresholds suggested
unilaterally by a particular player within the game can not increase its performance
gains.

For instance, in a game with three players, a strategy pro?le should satisfy three
conditions, one for each player, in order to be considered as a game solution. The
game would result in a strategy pro?le ( s s s ) based on the Nash equilibrium if,

3.1.3 Interpreting Equilibria in a Two-player, Two Strategy
Game
In order to interpret equilibria in terms of the determined thresholds, we consider
the conditions under which di?erent strategy pro?les may constitute a game solution.
The considered game is based on two players c and c each having two strategies
1 2
denoted as s and s . The corresponding strategy sets are given by, S = S =
1 2 1 2
s s . Table 3.2 shows this game. Moreover, there are four strategy pro?les in this
1 2
game, namely, (s s ) (s s ) (s s ) and (s s ).
1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2
Let us ?rst analyze the conditions under which the strategy pro?le ( s s ) will be
1 1
the game outcome. Based on Equation (3.10), (s s ) will be the game solution if,
1 1
c : s S u (s s ) u (s s ) where (s =s )
1 1 c 1 1 c 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
c : s S u (s s ) u (s s ) where (s =s ) (3.12)
2 2 c 1 1 c 1 1 1
1 2 2 1
Since in this game s S and s S means s , we can simplify the above
1 2 2

equation as,
c : u (s s ) u (s s )
1 1 1 1 1 2 1
c : u (s s ) u (s s ) (3.13)
2 2 1 1 2 1 2
11 11
The corresponding threshold pair ( ) will be the determined thresholds if the
conditions in Equation( 3.13) are met.
The conditions for the remaining strategy pro?les are similarly obtained based on
Equation (3.10). Table 3.3 summarizes the conditions for di?erent strategy pro?les

It is easy to obtain simpli?ed equations in games involving more than two strate-
gies for each player. Considering a two-player game with three strategies for each
player. This game is represented by a 3 3 payo? table similar to Table 3.2. There
will be nine strategy pro?les in this case. A particular strategy pro?le, say ( s s ),
1 1
would be the game solution if the conditions in Equation (3.12) are satis?ed. These

would result in more conditions for the two players. It is also easy to extend and ?nd
simpli?ed conditions for games with more players. For instance, Equation (3.11) is
used to analyze and obtain simpli?ed conditions for games with three players.
3.2 Establishment of Equilibria in GTRS
We examine equilibria in two-player games in GTRS. The uncertainty levels of
rough set regions are selected as players in these games. The objective of these games
is to reduce the overall uncertainty involved in the rough set based classi?cation.
The ?rst player (or player 1) named as the immediate decision region is denoted as
I. The second player (or player 2) named as the deferred decision region is denoted
as D. The player I represents the collective uncertainty in probabilistic positive
and negative regions. The player D represents the uncertainty in the probabilistic
boundary region. Con?guring the thresholds to decrease the uncertainty of player I
comes at a cost of an increase in uncertainty for player D. A trade-o? solution is
obtained by considering a game for determining the thresholds between uncertainty
of player I and player D.
We consider two games which will be referred to as Game 1 and Game 2 based
on the two players. The objective of these games is to con?gure the thresholds
41
??????,,?,,?,,,?,,?,
within the majority-oriented probabilistic rough set model given by the condition
0 < 0 5 1. The condition means that a particular equivalence class will
belong to the positive region if 50% or more objects in the equivalence class are in C.
In any other case, the equivalence class will belong to the negative region. In other
words, the distribution of objects in the positive region is biased towards C, and the
c
distribution of object in negative region is biased towards C [37].
The Game 1 is similar to a game that was previously reported in [57]. The
strategies for player I are considered as various levels of decreases in threshold
by some ?xed or constant amounts. For the sake of simplicity, three strategies are
considered with strategy s = decrease of by a constant k , strategy s = decrease
1 1 2
of by a constant k and strategy s = decrease of by a constant k , where
2 3 3
k <k <k . Similarly, the strategies for player D are formulated as various levels of
1 2 3
increases in by the same constants, i.e., k , k andk . Although the two players are
1 2 3
a?ected by both ( ) thresholds, we limit the strategies of player I to only and
the strategies of player D to only . The rationale behind this is that we want both
the players to have partial control (each player can modify only one threshold) over
the con?guration of thresholds. This will put a limit or constraint over the sel?sh
behaviour of the two players. That is player I can not simply choose an value that
is only in his favour as player D may respond by setting a value that will only be
advantageous to him. A threshold pair corresponding to a particular strategy pro?le
is determined as the change suggested in by player I and the change suggested in
by player D. The threshold pairs corresponding to di?erent strategy pro?les in this
game are shown in Table 3.4.
The Game 2 considers same type of strategies for the two players. The strategies

constant amount greater than 0. The two players full control over the con?guration
of thresholds in this game, i.e., each player is allowed to modify both the thresholds.
This means that each player is allowed to play in a way that will only bene?t him-
self. The game solution in this case intuitively mean the maximization of individual

sel?sh behaviours. A threshold pair corresponding to a particular strategy pro?le is
calculated based on two rules. If only a single player suggests a change in threshold,
the value will be determined as an increase or decrease suggested by that player. If
both the players suggest a change, the value will be decided as the sum of the two
changes. The threshold pairs corresponding to di?erent strategy pro?les in this game
are shown in Table 3.5.
For a particular strategy pro?le ( s s ) that leads to a threshold pair ( ) (for

the sake of simplicity we assume ( ) = ( )), the associated utility or payo?
functions for the players are represented by,
u (s s ) = (C ( )+C ( )) 2 and u (s s ) =C ( ) (3.15)
I m n P N D m n B
mn mn
As the strategy pro?le ( s s ) is associated with thresholds ( ) (which is
m n
assumed as ( ) in this case), we would denote the payo? functions u (s s ) and
I m n
u (s s ) in terms of the associated thresholds, i.e.,
D m n
u (s s ) = u ( ) (3.16)
I m n I
u (s s ) = u ( ) (3.17)

The payo? functions in Equation (3.15) are further simpli?ed as,

ditional probabilities follow the gaussian distribution given by e . Choosing
di?erent values for parameters and x will result in di?erent graphs although the

become apparent in the coming discussion that the selection of these parameters is
irrelevant to the game analysis. Therefore, one may choose di?erent values and can
still obtain the same results.
Let us ?rst consider the changes in utilities for player I based on threshold .
Figure 3.1 is constructed for this purpose. Each curve or series in the ?gure shows
the change in player I utility corresponding to di?erent values of and a ?xed value

We note from Figure 3.1 that for a ?xed value of , as the value of is increased

It should be noted that the results in Equations (3.22) - (3.25) do not depend
on the distribution of data. This may be seen intuitively by looking at the utilities
of the players. For instance, considering the utility of player I, decreasing from
1.0 would result in some incorrect classi?cations in the positive region irrespective of
the data distribution. As a result one would expect an increase in the uncertainty
of the positive region and therefore a decrease in the utility of player I. Decreasing
further will lead to more incorrect classi?cations in the positive region and will
therefore further decrease the utility of player I. The data distribution however plays
a role in determining how much decrease player I would be expecting based on a
certain decrease in , i.e., the magnitude of the decrease in utility of player I but not
the trend of decrease in itself.

3.2.1 Analysis of Nash Equilibria in Game 1
Let us analyze this game from player I’s perspective. Considering strategy s of
1
player D, the player I can choose from three possible strategies, i.e., s , s or s with
1 2 3
corresponding strategy pro?les given by ( s s ), (s s ) and (s s ), respectively.
1 1 2 1 3 1
The three strategy pro?les lead to the following threshold pairs (according to the
description of Game 1 and Table 3.4),
11 11
(s s ) ( ) = ( k +k )
1 1 1 1
21 21
(s s ) ( ) = ( k +k )
2 1 2 1
31 31
(s s ) ( ) = ( k +k ) (3.26)
3 1 3 1
According to Equations (3.16) and (3.17), the utilities of the players corresponding
to strategy pro?les are determined based on the associated threshold pairs. It follows
49
.?,???,??,,?,???,??,,?,???,??,,,,??
that,
u (s s ) =u ( k +k )
I 1 1 I 1 1
u (s s ) =u ( k +k )
I 2 1 I 2 1
u (s s ) =u ( k +k ) (3.27)
I 3 1 I 3 1
The three payo? functions make use of the same value for threshold , i.e., +k .

Since this game considers k <k <k , we have,
1 2 3
11 21 31
= ( k )> = ( k )> = ( k ) (3.28)
1 2 3
From Equations (3.22) and (3.28), we have,
u ( k +k )>u ( k +k )>u ( k +k ) (3.29)
I 1 1 I 2 1 I 3 1
that is, for any values of in range [0 5 1 0] and ?xed value of , the utility of I
decreases as decreases. Using Equations (3.27) and (3.29), we have,
u (s s )>u (s s )>u (s s ) (3.30)
I 1 1 I 2 1 I 3 1
It means that s is the best response of player I to s of player D according to
1 1
Equation (2.22). Similarly, it is easy to show that the best response of I to s and s
2 3
of player D is also s .

strategy pro?les given by ( s s ), (s s ) and (s s ), respectively. From Table 3.4 it
1 1 1 2 1 3
follows that,

(s s ) ( ) = ( k +k )
1 1 1 1

(s s ) ( ) = ( k +k )
1 2 1 2

and according to Equation (3.15), we have,

u (s s ) =u ( k +k )
I 1 2 I 1 2
u (s s ) =u ( k +k ) (3.32)
I 1 3 I 1 3
The three payo? functions make use of the same value, i.e., k . Since k <k <
1 1 2
k , we have,

which means that s is the best response of player D to s of player I. In the same
3 1
way, it is easy to show that the best response of D to s and s of player I is also s .
2 3 3
From above discussion, it becomes apparent that s and s are the dominant
1 3
strategies for players I and D, respectively (please refer back to Equation (2.20)
and the relevant discussion). This game will therefore have only one solution or
Equilibrium that will consist of both players playing their dominant strategies, i.e.,
the pro?le ( s s ).

3.2.2 Analysis of Nash Equilibria in Game 2
Let us now analyze equilibria in Game 2. We ?rst focus on the strategies of
player I. Considering s of player D, we want to determine the best response of
1
player I which can either be s , s or s with respective strategy pro?les given by
1 2 3
(s s ) (s s ) and (s s ). From description of Game 2 in Table 3.5, we notice that
1 1 2 1 3 1
the payo? functions corresponding to the considered pro?les are given by,
u (s s ) = u ( 2k )
I 1 1 I
u (s s ) = u ( k +k)

u (s s ) = u ( 2k +k) (3.36)

Comparing the payo? functions u ( 2c, ) and u ( 2c, +c). The two payo?
I I
functions share the same value, i.e., = 2c while < +c for any value of
c> 0. Following the results of Equation (3.24), we have,

thatis, increasing decreasesthepayo?forplayer I when is?xed, (seeFigure3.3).
From Equations (3.36) and (3.37), it follows that,
u (s s )>u (s s ) (3.38)

Similarly, following the results of Equations (3.22) and (3.36), we note that,

and s provide more payo? compared to s for player I based on player D choosing
2 3
s . Regarding which of the strategies s or s can provide more payo?, unfortunately
1 1 2
we are not able to compare them as they do not share a common threshold value.
It is reasonable to assume that both of them have equal chances for being the best
responses. It is easy to obtain similar results when we try to determine the best
response of player I based on strategy s and s of player D.
2 3
Let us now examine the strategies of player D. Considering the strategy s of
1
player I, it can either choose s s or s . The corresponding strategy pro?les are

u (s s ) = u ( k +k)
D 1 2 D
u (s s ) = u ( 2k +k) (3.40)

The strategy s can be compared with strategy s due to common value for the
1 3
threshold . Following the results of Equations (3.25) and (3.40), it follows that,
u ( 2k )<u ( 2k +k)

thatis,playerDcanexpectmorepayo?when isincreased,given remainsconstant
(see Figure 3.4). This means that s provides better payo? than s . We can also
3 1
compare strategy s and s due to common value of threshold . The results from
2 3
Equations (3.23) and (3.40) suggest that,
u ( k +k)<u ( 2k +k)

From above discussion it appears that only player D has a dominant strategy
which is s . The player I do not have dominant strategy, however, given the strat-
3
egy s of player D, it would respond with its best response by either playing s or
3 1
s . The game solution in this case is either (s s ) or (s s ) depending on which
2 1 3 2 3
strategy pro?le provides better payo?. It is easy to show that we can reach to similar
conclusions even if we consider di?erent values of c> 0 with the thresholds satisfying
0 < 0 5 1.

the GTRS to incorporate such situations can be a fruitful research direction. The
establishmentofequilibriainsuchgameswillrequiretoanalyzethesolutionconcepts
in cooperative game theory such as Nash bargaining solution [24].
It should also be noted that in the considered games, the strategies are based
on decreasing threshold and increasing threshold . This is the generally used
approach in the GTRS model. The strategies formulated in this way assumes an

Pawlak model [14]. In a recent article, di?erent approaches for formulating strategies
based on di?erent initial conditions are considered [11]. These approaches include
the two ends approach, the middle approach, the random approach and the range
based approach. The initial conditions in these approaches are the Pawlak model,
probabilistic two way model, (given by = ), random values for the thresholds and

a speci?ed range of thresholds, respectively. These approaches are discussed in detail
in Section 5.6.
How di?erent initial conditions will a?ect the game solution is an interesting
research issue in this context. In this study, we only considered the typical games
de?nedwithGTRS.However, theresultsobtainedinthisresearchcanbeextendedto
analyze games with di?erent initial conditions. For instance, considering the games
that start with an initial condition of = , i.e., probabilistic two-way model. It
is suggested that as opposed to the games that start from the Pawlak model, the
strategiesinthesegamesareformulatedbasedonincreasingthreshold anddecrease

and determine equilibria in such games.
3.3 Conclusion
The concept of equilibria is of central importance in the game-theoretic rough
set (GTRS) model. This chapter focuses on two equilibria related issues, i.e., the
interpretation of equilibria and the establishment of their existence. We address
the issue of interpretation of equilibria by examining the relationship between a game
solutionandthedecisionthresholdsthatcontroltheroughsetsbaseddecisionregions.
A game solution or equilibrium is interpreted in terms of a threshold pair such that
anychangesinthesethresholdssuggestedunilaterallybyasingleplayercannotresult
in a payo? or utility increase for that player within the game. A general two-player
game in GTRS is also de?ned which can be utilized as a basis for implementing
further games. It is also suggested that the interpretation of game solution may
be extended to games with more than two players. The issue of establishment of
56
????
equilibria is addressed by considering a couple of typical two-player games in GTRS.
The results suggest that the existence of equilibria may be established under certain
limited conditions.
The interpretation of equilibria setup the motivation for exploring other relevant
issues. Thismaypossiblyincludetheinvestigationofdi?erenttypesofgamesolutions,
their relationship to thresholds and their relative importance.

Uncertainty Analysis with GTRS
4.1 Introduction
Probabilisticroughsets[140]extendedthePawlak[84]roughsetmodelbyconsid-
eringprobabilisticinformationofobjectsbeinginasetfordeterminingtheirinclusion
inthethreeregions. Thedivisionsamongtheseregionsarede?nedbyapairofthresh-
old values. Although the Pawlak positive and negative regions provide a minimum
level of classi?cation errors, they are often applicable to a few objects [10, 37]. This
limits the practical applicability of the theory in real world applications [128, 140].
Probabilistic rough sets expanded rough sets applicability or generality by incorpo-
rating more objects in positive and negative regions at a cost of some classi?cation
errors [137]. A pair of thresholds controls the level of tradeo? between these two
properties.
Deng and Yao [37] proposed an information-theoretic interpretation of probabilis-
tic thresholds. The uncertainties with respect to di?erent regions are calculated by
utilizing the measure of Shannon entropy. By providing the notions of overall un-
certainty calculated as an average uncertainty of the three regions, the formulation
58
provides another motivation for studying the probabilistic rough sets. The Pawlak
positiveandnegativeregionshaveaminimumuncertaintyofzero,howeveritmaynot
have the minimum overall uncertainty due to large size of the boundary region [37].
Another extreme case is considered in the form of probabilistic two-way decision
model which as opposed to Pawlak model has a minimum size for the boundary re-
gion. The uncertainty level of boundary region has a minimum value, however the
overall uncertainty may not be necessarily minimum for the model. The probabilistic
rough set model is utilized to consider the tradeo? among uncertainties of the three
regions through suitable adjustments in threshold values.
The problem of ?nding an e?ective threshold pair was formulated as a minimiza-
tion of uncertainty of three-way classi?cation induced by the three regions in [37].
However, an explicit mechanism for searching or learning an optimal threshold pair
in the space of possible threshold pairs was not provided. We consider a GTRS based
method that utilizes a game-theoretic setting in automatically obtaining an e?ective
thresholdpairwitharepetitiveprocessforthresholdmodi?cation. Agradientdescent
approach was combined with the ITRS model to iteratively reduce the uncertainty of
the rough set regions in [39].
We use the GTRS model for analyzing the uncertainties of rough set regions in
theaimof?ndinge?ectivethresholds. Acompetitivegameisformulatedbetweenthe
regions that modify the thresholds in order to improve their respective uncertainty
levels. By repeatedly playing the game and utilizing its results for updating the
thresholds, alearningmechanismisproposedthatautomaticallytunesthethresholds

4.2 Uncertainties in the Probabilistic Rough Set Regions
The information-theoretic interpretation of probabilistic rough sets was formu-
lated in [37]. It can be used to compute uncertainties of the probabilistic rough set
regions. Although there are di?erent approaches for computing uncertainty, such as,
the Bayesian and stochastic approaches [28, 43], the considered formulation utilizes
the measure of Shannon entropy.
Considerapairofprobabilisticthresholds( )thatproducesthefollowingthree

The uncertainty of = CC with respect to the three probabilistic regions may
C
be computed with Shannon entropy as follows:
H( POS (C)) = P(C POS (C)) log P(C POS (C))
C ( ;  ) ( ;  ) ( ;  )
c c
P(C POS (C)) log P(C POS (C)) (4.2)

( ;  ) ( ;  )
The Equations (4.2) - (4.4) may be viewed as the measure of uncertainty in
C
with respect to POS (C), NEG (C) and BND (C) regions. The conditional
( ;  ) ( ;  ) ( ;  )
probabilities in these equations, e.g. P(C POS (C)) may be interpreted as the

The Equations (4.5) - (4.6) may be interpreted as the portion of POS (C) that

similarly obtained. The overall uncertainty is computed as the average uncertainty
of the three regions, which is referred to as conditional entropy of given ,

P (1;0) C (1;0)

The Pawlak model is usually associated with large size of the boundary region. The

that BND (C) C and BND (C) C , leading to P(C BND (C)) = 0

Let us now calculate the total uncertainty for probabilistic two-way decision model
given by = . For simplicity, we assume = = . Since the boundary size is

It may be observed that although Pawlak positive and negative regions have the
minimum uncertainty of zero, the boundary region has a large non-zero uncertainty.
On the other hand, probabilistic two-way decision model has zero uncertainty in

conditions in the form of no errors in de?nite regions (in the Pawlak model) and no

to obtain the minimum overall uncertainty level. Moderate levels of uncertainties for
the three regions may be examined through con?guration of probabilistic thresholds
between these two extreme cases.

0.76. The overall uncertainty in this case according to Equation (4.12) is given
by ?(1 0) = 0 76.

??•??••..,.•.,•.,?.,?.,?
threshold values is a central issue in this context. We investigate a mechanism that
may be utilized for analyzing the region uncertainties in order to determine suitable
threshold values in the next section.
4.3 AnalyzingUncertaintiesofRoughSetRegionswithGTRS
We now investigate an application of GTRS for analyzing uncertainties in di?er-
entprobabilisticregions. EarlierinSection4.2, therelationshipbetweenprobabilistic
thresholds and region uncertainties was demonstrated with an example. A key ob-
servation was that the con?guration of probabilistic thresholds controls the tradeo?
between uncertainties associated with di?erent regions. We aim to ?nd a mechanism
that e?ectively adjusts the threshold values in order to ?nd a suitable tradeo? among
the uncertainties associated with di?erent regions. The GTRS model may provide
such a mechanism.
4.3.1 Formulating Tradeo?s among Region Uncertainties as
a Game
The GTRS model has been recently applied to multiple criteria decision mak-
ing problems, such as multiple criteria based attribute classi?cation [8], feature se-
lection [12], improving classi?cation ability [57] and rule mining [10]. In order to
formulate further decision making problems, a GTRS based framework for multiple
criteria decision analysis was introduced in [10]. The framework suggests identi?ca-
tion of three basic components for formulating problems with GTRS. This includes
information about di?erent criteria considered as players in a game, the strategies or
67
available actions for each player and the utilities or payo? functions for each action.
We begin by identifying these components.
The players should re?ect the overall purpose of the game. Our objective in this
game is to improve the overall uncertainty level of the rough set classi?cation. As
noted in Section 4.2, changing the thresholds in order to improve the uncertainty of
boundary region comes at a cost of uncertainty in both positive and negative regions.
This intuitively suggests that the boundary region can be viewed as a common com-
petitor or opponent for both positive and negative regions. Due to this reason, we
consider the positive and negative regions as a single player in a game competing
against the boundary region.
Inroughsetliterature,thedecisionrulesfrompositiveandnegativeregionsversus
those from boundary region have been referred to as certain rules versus uncertain
rules [87], certain versus possible [49] and immediate versus delayed or deferred [54].
We adopt the terminology of reference [54] for referring to considered players. The
player set in this case is given by P = c c with player c representing immediate
1 2 1
decision region and is denoted as I and player c representing the deferred decision
2
region and is denoted as D.
The players compete each other in a game with di?erent strategies. The available
strategies highlight di?erent options or moves available to a particular player during
the game. Since the players in this game (i.e. the immediate and deferred decision
regions)area?ectedbychangesinprobabilisticthresholds,weformulatethesechanges
asstrategies. Threetypesofstrategies, namely, s ( , decreaseof ),s ( , increase
1 2
of ) and s ( , decrease of and increase of ) are considered. Although the
3
strategies may be formulated in di?erent ways, we considered the case where the
68
????????????},{
con?guration starts from an initial setting of ( ) = (1 0) which corresponds to the
Pawlak rough set model.

lectingaparticularstrategy. Theutilitiesshouldre?ectpossiblebene?ts,performance
gains or happiness levels of a particular player. As noted earlier, the uncertainties
of regions are a?ected by considering di?erent threshold values which are referred to
as possible strategies. Therefore, the levels of uncertainties associated with di?erent
regions may be considered as one form of utility or payo? functions. However, from
a particular player perspective, an uncertainty value re?ects a level of loss or disad-
vantage measured in the range of 0 to 1. An uncertainty of 1 means an extremely
undesirableconditionoraminimumpossiblegainforaplayerandanuncertaintyof0

for calculating the payo? functions, as in game-theoretic analysis we are interested in
measuring possible gains or bene?ts. The certainty of the three regions are de?ned

where u and u represent the payo?s corresponding to immediate and deferred

decision regions, respectively. The payo? is calculated as an average certainty of
the two regions, since immediate decision regions include both positive and negative
regions,
4.3.2 Competition between the Regions for Analyzing Un-
certainties
We form a game as a competition among the regions in order to analyze dif-
ferent region uncertainties. A payo? table is one way of expressing such a compe-
tition. The table facilitates analysis by providing listing of all possible situations
in a game. Table 4.3 shows the payo? table for the game between immediate and
deferred decision regions. The rows in front of the player I represent the strate-
gies of player I and the columns beneath the player D represent the strategies of
player D. Each cell in the table represents a particular strategy pro?le of the form
(s ,s ), where player I has selected strategy s and player D has selected s with
m n m n
s s . A payo? pair corresponding to a strategy pro?le ( s ,s )
m n m n
is represented as <u (s s ),u (s ,s )>. Finally, equilibrium analysis is performed
I m n D m n
to determine a possible game solution based on Equation 3.10 (equilibrium de?nition
for two player game).

In GTRS based formulation for analyzing probabilistic rough sets, it is suggested
that eachstrategy pro?le corresponds to a particular probabilistic threshold pair [10].
Since each cell of a payo? table corresponds to a strategy pro?le, this means that
each cell will have its corresponding ( ) pair. We note in Table 4.3 that each
cell corresponds to either an increase or decrease of thresholds. We represent these
changes by using the following notations,
= Only one of the measures suggests a decrease in threshold (4.22)
= Both of the measures suggest a decrease in threshold (4.23)
+
= Only one of the measures suggests an increase in threshold (4.24)
++
= Both of the measures suggest an increase in threshold (4.25)
Given these notations, a threshold pair corresponding to a strategy pro?le ( s ,s ) =

users or domain experts. This may involve plenty of trails before some reasonable
estimates are obtained. A better approach was discussed in [57]. A learning method
was introduced for calculating the increases or decreases in threshold values. At
each iteration of the learning process, the parameter adjustments are obtained as a
function of performance gains or losses in the considered criteria. We introduce a
similar learning mechanism that can be used to automatically obtain the necessary
adjustments in threshold values. In addition, the repetitive modi?cations will serve
as a guiding mechanism in reaching towards an e?ective threshold pair.
4.3.3 Learning Optimal Thresholds
The game-theoretic formulation allows for the adjustments in thresholds by con-
sidering a certain amount of increase or a decrease in value. These adjustments are
based on utilities of targeted players. Repetitive actions of modifying the thresh-
olds in order to continuously improve the utility levels of respective players lead to
a learning method. The learning principle in such a method may be based on the
relationship between modi?cations in threshold values and their impact on di?erent
region uncertainties. We consider this relationship in a game-theoretic environment.
We wish to achieve the following two objectives with this method.

Repetitive Threshold Modi?cations
WeconsiderthePawlakmodelasastartingpointinlearningthethresholdvalues.
As noted earlier in Section 4.2, the Pawlak model has zero uncertainty for immediate
decision regions. The deferred decision region, however, has a non-zero uncertainty.
In terms of utility or payo? functions this would mean that the utility of player I
would be maximum but that of player D may not be very e?ective. By adjusting
the thresholds repeatedly, we can decrease the uncertainty associated with deferred
decision region (i.e. Player D) at cost of an increased uncertainty for immediate
decision regions (Player I). Repeatedly doing so would mean that we may be able to
?nd an e?ective balanced point among the uncertainty levels of the two players. Such
a balanced situation will eventually lead to an e?ective setting for the probabilistic
thresholds.
Let us consider a single iteration of a game that will be repeated several times.
Suppose that the threshold values ( ) have been utilized in a particular iteration.
Equilibrium analysis within the game will be used to ?nd out the output strategy
pro?le and the corresponding threshold pair to that pro?le. This output threshold
pair is represented as ( ). The four variables given in Equations (4.22) - (4.25)
are calculated as,
= k ( (C ( ) C ( ))) (4.26)

= k ( (C ( ) C ( ))) (4.27)

Moreover, the threshold values for the next iteration are updated to ( ). The
variables k and k in Equations (4.26) - (4.29) are introduced to represent two dif-
1 2
ferent level of changes. The variable k represents a relatively lower or lesser change
1
in the thresholds and the variable k represents a higher change in the thresholds.
2
Therefore, k is considered to be less than k . An important issue is how to set the
1 2
values for these variables. This can be approached in di?erent ways. For instance,
one may investigate the data to set them or ask the domain expert to provide some
guidance in this regard. We consider the game outcome to determine them. The se-
lected strategies of the players will be used to determine the values of these variables
at each iteration.
In each iteration, the game will result in a certain strategy pro?le. Each strategy
+ ++
pro?lecorrespondstoone valueandone valuefromtheset ,
(where , means no change in the thresholds). For instance the pro?le ( s s ) =
3 3
++
( ) corresponds to ( ). Based on Equations (4.26) - (4.29), we know
that is the result of applying k and is the result of applying k . In the same
1 2
+ ++
way is the result of applying k and is the result of applying k . This means
1 2
++
that the thresholds in the pro?le ( s s ) = ( ), are the result of applying k .
3 3 2
We determine an average value that is based on the variables used in calculating the
two thresholds. In this case it will be (k +k ) 2 = k . The new values of k and
2 2 2 1
k for the next iteration are now calculated based on the average value. Denoting an
2
average value as k, the new value of k is determined as a unit value lesser than k,
1
i.e., k = k 1 and the new value of k is determined as a unit value greater than
1 2
k, i.e., k = k +1. For the thresholds which represent no change, we consider the
2
variable with the lower value, i.e., k as the corresponding variable, since it is closer
1

?/?,???,????????,???????,????,??}?,?,?,???,??,?{????,??
to no change compared to k .
2
Obtaining E?ective Probabilistic Thresholds with a Stopping Criteria
In order to obtain e?ective threshold values with in the learning environment,
we need to stop the learning process at a right time. This requires de?ning proper
stopping criteria. This may be formulated in di?erent ways, for instance, a bound on
number of iterations, our evaluations reaching some prede?ned limits or subsequent
iteration does not improve previously known best con?gurations. In [57] a stopping
criterion of players reaching some predetermined utility levels was utilized. This,
however, requires the users to provide the stopping utility levels according to their
beliefs. We utilize a di?erent approach in de?ning the stopping criteria.
The Pawlak model is considered as a starting point in our learning method. The
modi?cations of thresholds from this initial setting result in an increase of size for
positive region at a cost of associated increase in uncertainty level. When the size of
probabilisticpositiveregionexceedsthesizeofactualpositiveregion, wemaysuspect
that subsequent additions may cause more misclassi?cations which may lead to an
increase uncertainly level. Thus we set the stopping condition as,
POS (C) C
( ;  )
P(POS (C))>P(C) = > (4.30)
( ;  )
U U
Furthermore, when objects are continuously moved from the deferred decision region
to immediate decision regions, a situation may arise when the boundary becomes
empty. This situation may be considered as a probabilistic two-way decision model.
Themodi?cationofthresholdsbeyondthispointmaynotbeveryuseful. Forexample,
consider ( ) = (0 5 0 5), If is decreased to 0.4, the object x in an equivalence
75
?.,.?,?.||||||||
[x] with P(C [x]) = 0 45 will belong to both positive and negative regions. This is
an undesirable situation from decision making perspective. Therefore, in addition to
stoppingcriteriade?nedinEquation(4.30), wealsoutilizethestoppingcriteriagiven
by,
P(BND (C)) = 0 (4.31)
( ;  )
Finally, we also want to achieve a superior certainty level for immediate decision
regions as compared to the deferred decision region. From application perspective,
a rough set model may not be e?ective if there is greater uncertainty involved in
making immediate or certain decisions against deferred decisions. This leads to a
third stopping criterion for the learning algorithm which is de?ned as,
C +C
P N
<C =u <u (4.32)
B I D
2
In summary, we want the learning to stop if any one of the conditions in Equa-
tions (4.30) - (4.32) evaluates to false.

The selected threshold pair is used in line 7 - 8 for updating the required values.
Finally, the three stoping criteria listed in Equations (4.30) - (4.32) are given on

It may be useful to also look at theAlgorithm 1 from complexity and scalability

Once the positive, negative and boundary regions are determined, the calculation of
utilities based on Equations (4.20) and (4.21) will take constant time (lines 3 and 4).

critically depends on the number of iterations that may be required to determine the
thresholds. In regards to the scalability of Algorithm 1, the number of categories in
a data set is of crucial importance. For each category we need to run the algorithm
once in order to determine suitable ( ) settings.

feature in text applications, this leads to a very high dimensional feature space.
Featureselectionmethodsareusuallyadoptedtoreducethefeaturespacebyselecting
features that have relatively higher level of importance [9].
It was argued by [42] that if features are selected e?ciently, most of the infor-
mation is contained within the initial features. This argument got further strength
from experimental results reported in [32] and [81]. It was suggested that reduction
of features set from thousands to hundreds only result in less than 5% decrease of
accuracy. Based on these observations, we selected one hundred features based on chi
square feature selection method reported in [130].
We need to represent the textual documents in numeric form for e?cient process-
ing on computer machines. The document representation scheme of term frequency
inverse of document frequency was adopted for this task. Interested reader may ?nd
the details of this representation scheme in [104].
To run the threshold learning algorithm, we need to provide initial values for
the variables de?ned in Equations (4.26) - (4.29). We set the variable values as
+ ++
= 0 9, = 0 8, = 0 1 and = 0 2. This means that for the initial game,
the strategy pro?le ( s ,s ) = ( ) given by ( ) = (0 8 0 0) and the pro?le
1 1
++
(s ,s ) = ( ) = ( ) = (0 8 0 2). The rest of the threshold pairs
3 3
corresponding to di?erent strategy pro?les can be simillarly obtained as mentioned
in Section 4.3. Subsequent games will be generated based on this initial game until
one of the stopping criteria is reached.

4.5 Concluding Remarks
Game-theoretic rough sets or GTRS is a recent proposal in rough sets for ana-
lyzing and making intelligent decisions when multiple criteria are involved. In this
chapter, we investigated GTRS in analyzing region uncertainties de?ned with an
information-theoretic interpretation. The proposed approach exploits a relationship
between uncertainty levels of di?erent regions and probabilistic thresholds in order
to obtain e?ective threshold values. A competitive game between immediate and

ferentregionsbyconsideringappropriatestrategies. Thesestrategiesareincorporated
in a method to improve the overall uncertainty level of rough set based classi?cation.
By considering repeated modi?cations in threshold values as a process of decreasing
the overall uncertainty, a learning method was introduced that repeatedly tunes the
threshold levels for an improved performance. Experimental results on text catego-
rization suggest that the method may be e?ective for increasing the con?dence in
making certain decisions through reduction of overall uncertainty.
The proposed approach may be extended to other similar real world applications,
suchas,webpageclassi?cation,email?lteringandsentimentanalysis. Thethresholds
con?guration with respect to information-theoretic interpretation may be compared
with earlier game-theoretic threshold con?guration mechanisms, such as the game of
improving classi?cation ability.

Examining GTRS for Three-way Decisions
5.1 Introduction
Thischapterelaboratesthree-waymedicaldecisionmakingwithGTRStosupport
decision making in Web-based support systems (WSS). The study of WSS aims at
developing and transforming existing systems to support and extend various human
activities onto the Web [131, 134]. The motivation of WSS research came from the
realization of the Web as a common platform, medium and interface in supporting
andassistingactivitieslikemanaging, planning, searchinganddecisionmakingindif-
ferent ?elds [138]. An important area of WSS is Web-based decision support systems
(WDSS) that provide assistance for decision making in various domains [23, 97]. The
WDSS take advantages from opportunities provided by the Web such as increased
availability and e?ective user interfaces along with advances in intelligent decision
making techniques. Some of the recent examples of WDSS are found in the ?elds of
group decision making, business and waste management [74, 102, 115]. We consider
Web-based medical decision support systems (WMDSS) in this chapter.
The WMDSS have become a valuable aid for medical practitioners in making
85
e?ective decisions for selecting a course of action in medical diagnosis and treat-
ment [22, 118]. Komkhao, Lu and Zhang view the WMDSS from the viewpoint
of a recommender system where suitable decision recommendations are being made
by the system [68]. In any case, the WMDSS serve as a platform for integrating
evidence-based medicine into e?ective and e?cient care delivery. There are chal-
lenges in designing, developing and deploying WMDSS [36]. For example, e?ective
and meaningful user interfaces, recalling and retrieving relevant information, meet-
ing the reliability and accuracy expectations of decision making and prioritizing and
?ltering information to users, just to mention a few [36]. We focus on the decision
making aspect of WMDSS.
Uncertainty is one of a critical factor that a?ects reasoning and decision making
in the medical ?eld [48, 112]. A three-way decision making strategy that includes a
delay, deferment or non-commitment decision option is a better and useful approach
forreducingthee?ectsofuncertaintyindecisionmaking[141,142,144]. Aparticular
model in this regard in the medical ?eld was proposed by Pauker and Kassirer for
makingtreatmentdecisions [83]. Apair of testing and test-treatmentthresholdswere
used to de?ne the decisions of treatment, no treatment and delay treatment based on
the probability of a disease.
The fuzzy and rough set models can provide alternatives for three-way decision
making [84, 151]. The shadowed sets which generalize a fuzzy set into a three-valued
approximation provides a compelling approach for three-way decision making [93].
On the other hand, the rough sets and its extensions also lead to three-way deci-
sions by interpreting the rough set based positive, negative and boundary regions
as regions of acceptance, rejection and deferment, respectively. The game-theoretic
86
rough set (GTRS) model is a recent development in rough sets that provides yet
another approach in this regard. Particularly, the model provides a threshold con?g-
uration mechanism for determining e?ective threshold parameters to de?ne the three
probabilistic rough set regions and the implied three-way decisions [10, 14].
In Chapter 4, the applicability of GTRS model was demonstrated for e?ectively
determining the thresholds by setting the minimization of overall uncertainty level
of the probabilistic rough set regions as a game objective [14]. A repeated game
was de?ned that iteratively tunes the threshold parameters in order to improve the
overall uncertainty level in a game-theoretic learning environment. In this chapter,
we extend these results to investigate uncertainty in WMDSS.
5.2 Three-way Decision Making
Decisionmakingisaprocessthatproducesa?nalchoiceofanactionoranopinion.
Inmanysituations,decisionmakingmayinvolvemanyusefulchoicesandalternatives.
However,itisrelativelyeasytomakeadecisionwhenthenumberofchoicesislimited,
such as, two choices in the form of yes and no, true and false or accept and reject.
This leads to the generally used approach of binary or two-way decisions. In fact,
many decision making problems may be formulated as series of binary decisions.
Three-way decisions is an extension of two-way decisions with an added option
for deferring a certain decision [144]. Two-way decisions are generally based on crisp
judgments that leads to stringent outcomes such as yes or no, accept or reject and
true or false [154]. This sometimes may not be feasible from practical perspective
especially in situations where the evidence is insu?cient or weak due to absence or
lack of reliable information. One therefore may prefer an additional option such as
87
delaying or deferring a decision. For instance, a doctor obtains some test results to
look for the presence of cancer. A false decision in this case may take a human life.
If the evidence is not enough for reaching a certain decision, the doctor may want to
conduct additional tests thereby deferring a de?nite decision for a while. Three-way
decisionsisausefulextensionoftwo-waydecisionswithanaddedoptionofdeferment
decision [144]. It is worth-mentioning that di?erent researchers points essentially to
the same idea of deferred decisions by utilizing the terms such as delay, wait-and-
see (Herbert and Yao [54]), indecision (Baram [19]), abstain, non-commitment (Yao
[141]), uncertain (Pawlak [87]) and rejecting decisions (Hellman [50]).
5.2.1 An Outline Theory of Three-way Decisions
A general framework of three-way decision making was recently outlined by Yao
in [144].
ConsideringU as a ?nite nonempty set of objects and C as a set of criteria, objec-
tives or constraints. We divide U based on C into three disjoint regions, POS, NEG
andBNDcalledaspositive, negativeandboundaryregions, respectively. Thesethree
regions are utilized to induce rules for three-way decisions. The POS region gener-
ates rules for decisions of acceptance, the NEG region generates rules for rejection
and the BND generates rules for decision of non-commitment or deferment [141, 142].
The determination of an object for inclusion in a particular region depends on the
degree or level to which it satis?es the criteria in C. Particularly, the POS region
consist of objects whose satis?ability (for criteria in C) is at or above a certain level
of acceptance. The NEG region consist of objects whose satis?ability is at or below
a level of rejection. The BND region consist of objects whose satis?ability is above
88
the rejection level but below the acceptance level.
To formally explain the satis?ability of objects and the levels for acceptance and
rejection, Yao introduced the notions of evaluations of objects and designated values
for acceptance and rejection [144]. It was argued that evaluations provide the degrees
of satis?ability and the designated values for acceptance and rejection are the accept-
able degrees of satis?ability and non satis?ability of objects. A theory of three-way
decisions must consider 1) the construction and interpretation of a set of values for
measuring satis?ability and a set of values for measuring non-satis?ability, 2) the
construction and meaning of evaluations and 3) the determination and interpretation
of designated values [144].
There are many approaches to three-way decision making in the literature [19,
47, 93, 124, 145]. We focus on three of these approaches, namely, the GTRS based
approach, the shadowed sets approach and the threshold approach. As the GTRS
approach is already elaborated in detail, we only review the shadowed sets approach
and the threshold approach.
5.2.2 Three-way Decision Making Approaches
The Shadowed Sets Approach
The shadowed sets introduced by Pedrycz o?er a description of a particular fuzzy
set by considering three di?erent levels of membership grades [93]. A shadowed set
A is formally represented as,
A :X 0 [0 1] 1 (5.1)
89
,},,,{??
where X represents the universe and the range of A consists of three components,
i.e.,0,1andtheunitinterval[0,1]representingnomembership,completemembership
and uncertain or partial membership, respectively [94].
The shadowed sets de?ne two operations for an object, namely, the elevation and
reduction[94]. Theformerelevatesthemembershipgradeofanobjecttoameaningful
and acceptable level of grade and the later reduces the membership value to another
meaningful and acceptable level of grade. These two operations play a key role in
interpreting and constructing the three-valued approximation [38]. We elevate the
membership grade A(x) for an object x X to 1, if A(x) is greater than a certain
acceptable level. The membership grade is reduced to 0, if A(x) is below than a
certain rejection level. The membership grade will be either elevated or reduced if
A(x) is between the two levels. An important consideration in this framework is the
determination of suitable levels for acceptance and rejection of membership grades.
The notion of the so called -cut of a fuzzy set was introduced to de?ne the ( 1 )
model for interpreting the levels for acceptance and rejection in [94]. A decision-
theoreticcostsensitiveapproachfordeterminingthetwolevelswasconsideredin[38].
Itsworthpointingoutthatfurtherinsightsmaybegainedintothedeterminationand
interpretation of the two levels from granular computing perspective when they are
being considered as levels for admitting or excluding in an information granule [95,
136].
Thethreemembershiplevelsorgradesintheshadowedsetsprovideanimmediate
interpretation from decision making perspective. For an element x X with its
evaluation determined by the membership grade represented as A(x). If A(x) = 1,
the object is assumed to be compatible with the set or concept conveyed by A and
90
???,???
is accepted for A. If A(x) = 0, the object is not in accordance with the concept
determined by A and is rejected for A. If an element receives a membership grade
in the unit interval [0,1], it is uncertain and we are not able to allocate any numeric
grade. A decision of acceptance or rejection is not being made in this case.
The Threshold Approach
The threshold approach was proposed by Pauker and Kassirer for making medical
treatmentdecisions[83]. Theprobabilityofadiseasewasusedtoevaluateaparticular
decision. A pair of testing and test-treatment thresholds were de?ned with testing
threshold being less then the test-treatment threshold. The testing threshold de?nes
a level for rejecting or refusing to provide a treatment. Particularly, if the probability
of a disease is lesser than the testing threshold, the disease is suggested to be absent
thereby additional diagnosing tests are avoided and treatment is withheld. The test-
treatment threshold de?nes an acceptable level for providing a treatment. If the
probability of a disease is above the test-treatment threshold, the disease is suggested
to be present and immediate treatment is provided without any further testing. If
the probability is between the two thresholds, the presence or absence of a disease
is inconclusive. Additional diagnosing tests are performed with a treatment decision
depending on the test outcome.
Thetwothresholdsarea?ectedbydi?erentfactorssuchasthecost, bene?t, avail-
abilityande?ectivenessoftreatmentandtheaccuracy,reliabilityandrisksassociated
with diagnostic testing [25]. The determination of threshold values based on multiple
and sometimes con?icting aspects is a key challenge in this context. An approximate
91
rather then exact solution may be possible that considers a tradeo? among multi-
ple criteria a?ecting the two thresholds. An investigation of some soft computing
technique may be acknowledged for ?nding and reaching such a solution.
The GTRS Approach
The above mentioned approaches have their own advantages when considered
in di?erent perspectives, for instance, the shadowed sets approach provide a more
meaningful and understandable interpretation of the fuzzy membership grades. The
use of GTRS is essentially associated with at least two distinguishing characteristics
compared to other models for three-way decision making.
Firstly, whereas other three-way decision models rely on a separate and external
mechanism to model the determination of thresholds, the GTRS model provide a
uni?ed formalism for three-waydecisions and threshold determination [14]. In partic-
ular, the game mechanism provide the threshold determination and the determined
thresholds are used in the probabilistic rough set framework to induce three-way
decisions.
Secondly, the abilityto determine the threshold levels based on a tradeo? solution
between multiple criteria can comparatively lead to more e?ective and moderate
levelsforacceptance, rejectionanddefermentdecisions[132]. ThismeansthatGTRS
provide the possibility of making more stable and reliable decisions based on multiple
aspects, properties or criteria.

5.3 AnArchitectureofWeb-basedMedicalDecisionSupport
Systems
A WMDSS contains various components with functionalities ranging from sup-
porting end user activities and interaction through interface to maintaining and ma-
nipulating the knowledge within the system. We adapt the architecture of rough set
based WMDSS proposed by Yao and Herbert [131, 134]. The architecture is slightly
modi?ed to incorporate a GTRS component that will assist in decision making. Fig-
ure5.1representsthegeneralarchitectureofaWMDSS.Wedescribethisarchitecture
as comprising of an interface, management and data layers. Each of these layers are
now brie?y discussed.
Figure 5.1: Architecture of a Web-based Medical Decision Support System
93
Interface Layer
The web and internet makes up the interface layer. The clients interact with the
system that is designed on the server side through an interface that is supported
by the Web and internet. The interface is presented to the clients with the help
of Web browsers. It is used by the users to input any relevant information that
the system require. In addition, it is also responsible for providing services and
functionalities like searching, storing or obtaining data analysis results for supporting
andmakingdecisions. Acarefullydesignedwebinterfaceisverycriticalforthesuccess
of the whole system. It has to be clear, complete, consistent and should provide user
guidance and auto correction facilities.
Management Layer
This layer serves as the middleware of the three layer architecture. The informa-
tion from the top or bottom layers are processed at this layer before being presented
toupperorlowerlayers. Intelligenttechniquestoanalyzedatasuchaslogic,inference
and reasoning play a key role at this layer.
SometypicalcomponentsthatarerequiredatthislevelareDatabaseManagement
System, Knowledge Management, an intelligent decision making component such as
GTRS, Knowledge Discovery/Data Mining and Control Facilities. The Database
Management System binds the patient database and the GTRS component by mak-
ing the data available from the database to the GTRS component. The Knowledge
ManagementprovidesaccesstotheKnowledgeBasewhichcontainstherulesdatabase
and thresholds database. The GTRS component makes use of a game-theoretic en-
vironment in analyzing data to acquire knowledge in the form of three-way decision
94
rules. The Knowledge Discovery component is responsible for mining important in-
formation based on patient’s data and knowledge base. In some sense it also serves
as an information retrieval component where it searches and retrieves important pat-
terns in data corresponding to di?erent user queries. Finally, the Control Facilities
component provides functionalities such as access rights and permissions to patients
data.
Data Layer
This layer contains data necessary for the operation of the system. A major
portion of the data at this layer appears in the form of patient database whichis pop-
ulated by recording series of questions, observations and trails performed on patients.
From decision making perspective, the symptoms corresponding to a disease makeup
the most important part of this database. The GTRS and information retrieval com-
ponents access this database for analysis and retrieval purposes, respectively.
ThedatalayeralsocontainstheKnowledgeBasecomponentwhichcontainsinfor-
mation about three-way decision rules in the rules database. Rules are learned from
the data using the GTRS component and are utilized to make decisions of accep-
tance, rejection and deferment. The decision rules are accompanied by the threshold
levels in the threshold database which provides the levels for inducing and making
three-way decisions.

5.4 IncorporatingGTRSinWMDSSforThree-wayDecision
Making
To illustrate how the GTRS component a?ects decision making in a web-based
medical decision support systems, we consider a case of treating a possible disease.
The system will make a treatment decision based on some properties recorded in
the form of symptoms or medical tests corresponding to a patient. Table 5.1 presents
informationaboutpreviouspatientsalongwiththepasttreatments. Thisinformation
may be retrieved form the patients database. The rows of the table represent the
information that is recorded against each patient. The columns S S and S are
1 2 3
di?erent characteristics shown by the human body that help in making a treatment
decision. Theymaybeofdiscretevaluessuchasbinaryifthesymptomsareevaluated
basedonpresenceorabsence. Alternatively,theymayberealnumbersreportingsome
properties like blood pressure or cholesterol level. We consider the case of binary
values for the sake of simplicity. The last column represents successful treatments in
the past.
In order to do meaningful analysis using a rough sets based technique, such as,
GTRS, we need to have data in the form of an information table. Table 5.1 is
essentially an information table since the set of objects (perceived as patients) are
described by a set of attributes (perceived as set of symptoms and treatment) [149].
Let X represents an equivalence class which is the set of patients having the same

The concept of interest in this case is Treatment = Yes. We want to approximate
thisconceptintheprobabilisticroughsetsframeworkusingEquations(2.10)-(2.12).
The association of each equivalence class X with the concept, i.e., P(C X ) needs to
i i
be determined for this purpose in order to approximate the concept by three regions.
The conditional probability is,

are calculated as 1 0 1 0 0 8 0 75 0 5 0 33 0 2 and 0 0, respectively. The prob-
ability of an equivalence class X is determined as P(X ) = X U which means
i i i
that the probability of X is X U = 1 27 = 0 037. The probabilities of other
1 1
equivalence classes X X are similarly calculated as 0.074, 0.1851, 1481, 0.1481,

0.111, 0.1851 and 0.111, respectively.
We now analyze the uncertainties involved in making decisions based on the in-
formation given in Table 5.1 and the uncertainties involved in probabilistic rough
set regions discussed in Chapter 4. The uncertainties of the regions based on a
certain ( ) thresholds is calculated by determining the POS (C), NEG (C)

andBND (C)regions. Consideringthethresholds( ) = (1 0),thethreeregions

should be noted that the procedure for calculating uncertainties will remain the same
incaseof real orintegervaluedattributes. This is because individual attribute values
only take part in determining equivalence classes. Once the equivalence classes are
determined, theuncertaintiesinvolvedindi?erentregionsarecalculatedbasedonthe
equivalenceclassescontainedindi?erentregions. Inotherwords, theattributevalues
are not directly used in calculating region uncertainties. The only di?erence one may
expect in case of real or integer valued attributes is having more equivalence classes
due to more variety in the data values.

to generate three-way decisions
Let us interpret the GTRS results from a medical practitioner perspective. Con-
sidering a patient x belonging to an equivalence class X with conditional probability

P(C X ), i.e., level of con?dence in making a treatment decision. We have 78% cer-
i
tainty in making correct treatment decision if the level of con?dence for treating x is
set to greater than or equal to 0.8 and the level of con?dence for not treating x is set
to less than or equal to 0.4. When the level of con?dence is less than 0.8 but greater
than 0.4, we are unable to decide whether to treat or not thereby deferring a certain
treatment decision. The deferred decisions have 72% certainty which can be further
explored and utilized when additional information is made available. The threshold
levels a?ect the certainty level of the two players. The game-theoretic formulation
aims to achieve a suitable tradeo? between the two types of decisions.
5.4.1 Experimental Results and Discussion
We investigate the usage of the GTRS based approach outlined in Chapter 4 on
four di?erent health care datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning reposi-
tory [18]. Below is a brief description of these these datasets, namely, contraceptive

UCI Datasets
Contraceptive Method Choice (CMC)
The data in this dataset is taken from the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive
Prevalence Survey. The records correspond to married women who were either not
pregnant or did not know if they were pregnant at the time of data collection. The
problem is to determine the contraceptive method choice of the women’s as No-
use, Long-term, or Short-term methods based on demographic and socio-economic
characteristics. Thereare1,473recordsand10attributesincludingtheclassattribute.
Haberman’s Survival (HS)
This dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and
1970attheUniversityofChicago’sBillingsHospital. Thestudyconsidersthesurvival
of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. The problem is to decide
and predict wether the patient survived 5 years or longer ( 5 years) or the patient
died within 5 years (<5 years). The dataset contains 306 instances and 4 attributes.
Thyroid Disease(TD)
There are di?erent datasets in the UCI repository under this name. We used
the new thyroid dataset. It contains information about ?ve lab tests to determine a
patient thyroid as Euthyroidism, Hypothyroidism or Hyperthyroidism. There are 215
patient records with 6 attributes including the class attribute.

threshold settings of (1,0) which corresponds to Pawlak model. We have maximum
utility for player I, i.e., 1.0 and moderate utility for player D, i.e., 0.437. As the
method continues, the thresholds are modi?ed based on game-theoretic analysis and
game outcomes. The probabilistic positive, negative and boundary regions change in
104

size based on con?guration of thresholds which ultimately leads to di?erent uncer-
tainty levels and utilities for players. The sizes of positive and negative regions keep
on increasing while the boundary region keeps on decreasing. The method stops at

was reached. The certainty of de?nite decision region decreased by 19.1% while the
certainty of deferred decision region increased by 31.7%. The de?nite decision region
increasedby30.5%whichmeansthatwehavemoreimmediatedecisions. Anintuitive
interpretation of these results is that by decreasing our expectation of making 100%
certain decisions to 80.9% certain decisions, we included 30.5% of additional cases to
our de?nite or immediate decision region that were previously unknown to us. The
?nal threshold con?guration is ( ) = (0 476 0 168).
Table 5.5 shows the results for category Long-term of CMC dataset. The method
reaches the stop criteria in slightly more iterations. The con?gured thresholds in
this case correspond to ( ) = (0 56 0 154). The certainty of the deferred decision
region increased by 15.4% at a cost of 8.4% decrease in the certainty of de?nite

more and greater than the certainty decreases of immediate decision regions. This is
acceptable as the overall certainty or utility of the two players has improved.

sidering the CMC dataset, the results are quite encouraging for the three categories.
The sizes of de?nite decision regions increased by 30.5%, 15.3% and 14.4% for the
three categories as indicated by the black bars. Comparing the white and grey bars
for the three categories of this dataset. The increases in certainty of deferred decision
regions are more then decreases in certainty of the immediate decision regions for the
three categories. This means that the overall uncertainty is improved to a certain
extent. The HS dataset showed the most signi?cant improvements. The black bars

for the two categories of this dataset indicate that the immediate decision regions
increased by 43.8% and 38% for the two categories. A considerable improvement in
certainty of deferred decision regions are also noticed from the grey bars indicated in
the ?gure. The table also suggests some improvements, although not very signi?cant
on the TD and PID datasets.
Further Analysis and Discussion
We further analyze the decision making capabilities of GTRS by considering the
qualityofobtaineddecisionregions. Thepropertyofclassi?cationaccuracyofdecision
regions is considered for this purpose which is de?ned in Equation (6.6). The option
of deferred decision in GTRS reduce some misclassi?cations which will lead to an
improved accuracy compared to other methods. In order to have a better insight and
comparable results, we also include the deferred decision rate, i.e., the percentage
of decisions that are being deferred (also called as non-commitment rate [37]). The
deferred or non-commitment rate is the relative size of the boundary region with
respect to the universe, i.e.,

90.57% was noted with non-commitment rate of 34.3%. This means that the GTRS
was able to classify 65.7% with a success or accuracy rate of 90.57%. Additional

information is needed to make certain decisions about the remaining 34.3% of the
objects.
An important issue while considering the GTRS based performance is that it
requires additional information for some objects. In the absence of such information,
one may feel uncertain with remaining doubts about its performance. Let us look at
theGTRSperformanceinaworstcasescenariowherewehavenoaccesstoadditional
information and we are asked to make certain decisions about the deferred cases.
Suppose that random decisions are being made with a 50% chance of being correct
and another 50% of being incorrect. In this case, the GTRS provide 90.57% correct
decisionsfor65.7%oftheobjectsand50%correctdecisionsfortheremaining34.3%of
theobjects. Theaverageaccuracyinthiscaseis(90 57 0 657)+(50 0 34) = 76 65%.
Thisiscomparableandtocertainextendquiteencouragingwhenweconsidersomeof
thepreviousresultsforthesamedataset. Forinstance, afuzzydecisiontreeapproach
was reported to have 76.2% accuracy [31]. The same research reported accuracies of
63.86%, 50.8% and 40.85% for the neural network, support vector machine and k-
nearest neighbour approaches. Some other known approaches like C4.5 and k-means
were reported to have 61.67% and 66.66% accuracies, receptively [3].
Another important characteristic of the GTRS is that it require additional infor-
mation about a proportion of the objects in order to improve its performance. For
example, in case of the CMC dataset, 34.3% of the objects needs additional infor-
mation to be certainly classi?ed. There is no explicit mechanism in conventional
two-way decision methods to identify the cases that require additional investigations.
They require additional information for all objects in order to further improve their
performance.
109
..×.×.
We now consider the case of the HS dataset. The GTRS based method achieved
a decision accuracy of 83.5% with a non-commitment rate of 42.9%. The deferred
decision region in this case is slightly larger compared to the CMC dataset where it
was found to be 34.3%. The size of this region is expected to decrease if we lower the
expectation of being highly accurate or when additional information is being made
available. Once again considering the constraints of no additional information and
forced two-way certain decisions. Under these constraints, the GTRS make 83.5%
correct decisions for 57.1% objects and a 50% chance of correct decisions for the
remaining 42.9% objects. The average accuracy in this case is 69.12% which is worst
butstillcomparabletosomeotherapproachesintheliterature. Forinstance,C4.5was
reported to have 71.7% accuracy [30]. The Naive Bayesian and SVM were reported
to have accuracies of 73.83% and 73.52%, respectively [79].
The results for the datasets TD and PID were quite encouraging. The deci-
sion accuracies for the TD and PID datasets were 98.64% and 98.66% with a non-
commitment rates of 7.7%, 8.1%, respectively. The deferred decision regions for these
datasets were comparatively small implying many certain decisions. This means that
correct decisions are con?dently made for majority of the objects. If we consider the
constraints as discussed above, i.e., no additional information and forced two-way
certain decisions, the average accuracies are 94.89% and 94.72% for the TD and PID
datasets, respectively. Theseresultsarequitepromisingwhencomparedwithsomeof
the existing results. For instance, an information gain based approach and Fuzzy C-
Means were reported to have accuracies of 95.9% and 83.7%, respectively, for the TD
dataset [4, 67]. On the other hand, an approach based on combining regression with
neural networks and another approach based on dicriminant analysis with support
110
vector machine demonstrated accuracies of 80.21% and 79.16%, respectively, for the
PID dataset [66, 96]. Further improvements in the GTRS performance is expected
by providing additional information for the remaining 7.7% and 8.1% of the objects
in the deferred decision regions of the TD and PID datasets, respectively.
The results presented in this section advocate for the use of a GTRS component
in WMDSS as an alternative way for obtaining e?ective decision support for di?erent
medical decision making problems.
5.5 An Additional Approach for Three-way Decisions with
GTRS
Three-way decisions in probabilistic rough sets are based on the evaluation of
a particular equivalence class with respect to a given concept. Based on the same
settingweconsidertheevaluationofasingleequivalenceclasstomakedecisionswithin
a game. Di?erent players may evaluate an equivalence class di?erently, potentially
leadingtodi?erentresultsanddecisions. Generallyspeaking,eachplayermayformits
own opinion or perception about an equivalence class by considering the optimization
of its respective utilities or payo? functions. However, when the players interact in
a game, they adjust their personal believes based on their opponents chosen actions
until they are jointly or mutually consistent. Such an agreed position, if exists in a
game, is termed as a game solution or equivalently an equilibrium.
111
The Formulated Game
We setup a game that involves two players. A binary or two-way decisions are
considered for each player corresponding to an equivalence class. A player may either
choosetoacceptormaydecidetorejectanequivalenceclassbasedonsomeevaluation
measures. This is represented by considering two strategies for each player, i.e.,
strategy s = accept and strategy s =reject. Strategy s = accept is desired in
1 2 1
cases when the evaluation results obtained with a particular criterion are convincing
enough to accept an equivalence class as positively belonging to a concept. The
strategy s = reject will be of interest when the evaluation results are convincing
2
enough to reject an equivalence class as negatively belonging to a concept. The two
players realized as evaluation criteria for an equivalence class will determine their
respective utility for considering di?erent strategies using suitable payo? functions.

The solution concept of Nash equilibrium may be utilized to determine the pos-
sible outcome of the game. There are four possible outcomes of this game based
on the considered strategies. Each outcome is of the form (s s ), where player c

Three Decisions based on the Game Outcomes
The game outcomes or results outlined in Table 5.11 lead to the following three
cases.
Bothplayersagree on acceptance (accept,accept): Thiscasemaybetheresult

u (accept,accept ) u (reject,accept )
c c
1 1
u (accept,accept ) u (accept,reject ) (5.6)

This means that the players c and c can not increase their respective payo?s by

.??}{?,????????
switching their strategies from accept to reject. In this situation there is no dis-
agreement or uncertainty regarding the decision about an equivalence class. Due to
consensus of players about an equivalence class being positively evaluated as belong-
ing to a concept, we may interpret the set of all equivalence classes associated with
such outcome as belonging to the positive region. The decision of acceptance may be
de?ned for equivalence classes associated such game outcomes.
Both players agree on rejection (reject,reject): The game may result in this
outcome if the following conditions hold.
u (reject,reject ) u (accept,reject )

Thissuggeststhatnoneoftheplayerscanattainadditionalbene?tsbyswitchingtheir
respective strategies from reject to accept. Again, there is no disagreement among
the players regarding the decision about an equivalence class. We may interpret
the set of all equivalence classes associated with such outcome as belonging to the
negative region. The decision of rejection may be associated with equivalence classes
associated with such game results.
The players have disagreement (accept,reject) or (reject,accept): The game
will result in this outcome if any of the following pair of conditions are true.

while player c selects strategy reject. Similarly, Equation (5.9) represents a game

output when c selects reject while c selects accept. In any of these two cases, there
1 2
is a disagreement about an equivalence class. This represents an uncertain situation
as there is a disagreement between the two players. An immediate acceptance or
rejection decision may not be possible in this case. A third decision namely, the
non-commitment or deferment decision may be associated with such cases.
The realization of game outcomes in the form of above three cases immediately
leads to three decision regions and the implied three-way decisions with the following

5.6 Strategy Formulation Approaches for Inducing Three-
way Decisions
We identify four approaches that may be used for formulating strategies with
GTRS in order to obtain e?ective thresholds. A game is de?ned for each of these
approaches and the threshold modi?cation trend based on these approaches is also
studied.
The Two Ends Approach
ThegenerallyusedapproachforformulatingstrategiesinGTRSistoconsidersuit-
able decreasing levels for threshold and increasing levels for threshold . Examples
of this approach can be found in [10, 14, 57]. The strategies formulated in this way
commonly consider an initial con?guration of thresholds values, i.e. ( ) = (1 0)
that corresponds to the Pawlak model. We call this approach as the two ends ap-
proach since the threshold values are being modi?ed from the two extreme ends.

1 2 3

An example game based on this approach is presented in the form of Table 5.12.
Each player in this game considers three strategies, namely s = (decrease ),
1
s = (increase ), and s = (decrease and increase ). The increases or

(a) The two ends Approach (b) The middle approach
(c) The random approach (d) The range approach
Figure 5.3: The four approaches for threshold determination
decreases may be set by the user or may be de?ned in terms of the utilities attained
by the players. The outcome of this game may be used to repeat the game based on
new values of the thresholds. As the game repeats, the threshold is continuously
decreased while threshold is increased. The amount of an increase or decrease
depends on the outcome of the implemented game. Figure 5.3(a) shows the general
threshold modi?cation trend with this approach. The modi?cations in the threshold
values are not necessarily linear with respect to iterations. The stop criteria with this
approach should be de?ned to ensure that the process stops before the threshold
becomes less than or equal to . This approach may be useful when the data are
of high quality and the classes or concepts are well de?ned. A minimum size for
the boundary region may be expected in this case. One can make certain decisions
117
????
with high accuracy rate while keeping the value of close to 1.0 and close to
0.0. This means that an e?ective model may be obtained by considering some minor
adjustments to threshold values ( ) = (1 0).
The Middle Approach
An alternative approach for formulating strategies is to consider the threshold
modi?cation from an initial threshold setting given by = that corresponds to the
two-way decision model. Considering the constraint < , a formulated game based
onthisapproachshouldconsiderstrategiesforincreasing anddecreasing . Insome
sense this approach can provide an opposite mechanism for threshold con?guration
as compared to the two ends approach (where threshold keeps decreasing while
keeps increasing). As the thresholds are being modi?ed from a common or middle
value, we name this approach as middle approach.
Table 5.13: Game for middle approach
c
2
s = s = s =
1 2 3
s = .... ..... .....
1
s = .... ..... .....
2
c
1
s = .... ..... .....
3
An example game for this approach may be implemented as shown in Table 5.13.
This game consider opposite strategies compared to those considered in the game for
the two ends approach (see Table 5.13). The strategies may be interpreted as s =
1
(increase ), s = (decrease ), and s = (increase and decrease ).
2 3
When this game is played repeatedly, the threshold is expected to increase and
118
??????????????????????????????????????,?,???
is expected to decrease. Figure 5.3(b) shows the expected development in the two
threshold values based on the repeated game. The stop conditions in this approach
should be carefully designed such that the iterative process stops before the Pawlak
model is reached. This approach may be useful to compare the probabilistic two way
decision model and the probabilistic three-way decision model. Particularly, it can
provide further insights into the performance related issues associated with the two
models.
This approach may be used when the data are of low quality and involve a high
level of uncertainty. In such cases we expect many objects in the boundary region
leading to its larger size. The number of available certain decisions are very limited.
The objective in such situations is to reduce the boundary size to allow for some
certain decisions at a cost of some decrease in the level of accuracy. The middle start
which starts from zero sized boundary can provide useful con?guration of thresholds
under these conditions.
The Random Approach
We may consider a random point for starting the threshold con?guration with
GTRS. In this case we do not have any knowledge about the modi?cation direction
that will provide e?ective threshold values. In other words, we are not sure wether
to increase or decrease a particular threshold. In some cases, increasing a threshold
in its value may be a better choice while in others a decrease may be suitable option.
The formulated strategies should therefore provide options for both increasing or
decreasing a particular threshold. This means that the strategies will allow us to
investigate e?ective threshold values in the neighborhood of the starting random
119
point.
Table 5.14: Game for random approach
c
2
s = s =
1 2
s = .... .....
1
c
1 s = .... .....
2
The game for implementing this approach may be formulated in di?erent ways.
Table 5.14 presents an example game. Here the strategies for the two players are
di?erent. Players 1 has the strategies s = (increase ) and s = (decrease
1 2
) and player 2 has the strategies s = (increase ) and s = (decrease ).
1 2
Such a game may be realized when player 1 is considering some property of the
negative region while player 2 is re?ecting the same or some other property of the
positive region. Figure 5.3(c) presents the general threshold modi?cation trend with
this approach. Unlike the two ends and middle start approaches the thresholds
and are not strictly increasing or decreasing. This approach provides more freedom
and a chance to ?ne tune the thresholds by allowing additional options in threshold
modi?cations. An implementation of this approach should provide a con?guration
that is at least better than the initial random point. However, an overall optimal
con?guration may be not be necessarily achieved. A multi-start strategy can also be
considered with this approach where each starting point has an additional chance to
be within the locality of global optimum [27]. Finally, this approach may be suited
to applications that are associated with an intermediate level of uncertainty where
the e?ective threshold values can be located anywhere in the threshold space.
120
??????????????????????
The Range Approach
The strategies may also be formulated by considering a possible range of values
for the thresholds. It may not be feasible to evaluate and consider the entire set of
values contained in the range within a single game, however, some selected values
from the range may be represented as possible strategies. The game may start from
a wider range which is iteratively reduced to a ?ner range based on a game outcome
in a repeated game.

1 1 n n
s = .... ..... ....
1 1
c
1 ... .... ..... ....

The game in Table 5.15 may be used to implement this approach. Considering an
initial range for threshold as [0 5 1 0], the strategies s = s = s =
1 1 2 2 n n
are representing di?erent values in the considered range. Realizing an order among
the strategies such as < < . The strategy may represent the lower value

the range [0.5,1.0] for may be reduced by a factor of 2 as (1 0 0 5) 2 = 0 25.
The new range may be centered around the threshold values determined by the game

outcome. Figure 5.3(d) presents the general trend in modifying thresholds with this
approach. The approach may be useful when we are faced with tight computing
constraint and quick convergence or determination of thresholds is desired.
Summary
Additional approaches for formulating strategies are examined based on di?erent
initial conditions. The implementation of these approaches is realized by considering
example games corresponding to each approach. The iterative threshold modi?cation
with these approaches based on a repetitive game is also discussed. It is argued that
some of these approaches may be more appropriate when di?erent types of data and
applications are considered. A demonstrative example advocates for the usability of
the suggested approaches.
5.7 Concluding Remarks
We examine and extend the decision making capabilities of Web-based medical
decision support systems. Medical decision making typically involve uncertainty and
athree-waydecisionmakingapproachisabetterchoicetoreducetheimpactofuncer-
tainty. The concept of three-way decisions was recently incorporated in the rough set
theory for interpreting the three rough set regions as regions of acceptance, rejection
and deferment. We consider three-way decisions in the probabilistic rough set model
which is the generalized representation of rough sets. A fundamental problem with
the model is the interpretation and determination of probabilistic threshold parame-
ters that de?ne the division between the three rough set regions. The game-theoretic
roughsetorGTRSmodelhasbeendemonstratedfordetermininge?ectivethresholds
122
for probabilistic rough sets by analyzing the uncertainties involved in the probabilis-
tic rough set regions and the implied three-way decisions. We incorporated a GTRS
component in a WMDSS architecture in the aim of enriching its decision making
capabilities. The bene?ts from a GTRS component is demonstrated by considering a
GTRS based method for improving the overall uncertainty level of three-way classi?-
cation. The method is based on a repetitive process where each iteration modi?es the
probabilistic thresholds in order to improve the overall uncertainty of rough set based
regions and their respective decisions. The method provides encouraging results on
four di?erent medical datasets.

Chapter 6
GTRS for Recommender Systems
6.1 Introduction
The internet or Web users are commonly confronted with situations where there
aremanypotentiallyusefulchoicesforselectinganitemofinterest. Makingasuitable
decision, such as a purchase decision, generally involves an urge to narrow down the
search to a few but important choices. Web-based recommender systems (WRS) as a
special kind of Web-based support systems, were introduced with the intent of han-
dlingrelevantinformationinordertoprovideusefulandcustomizedrecommendations
to their users [2, 103].
There are many techniques and approaches proposed in the literature that are
used to develop di?erent recommender systems. The most common approaches are
content based, collaborative based, knowledge based and demographic based recom-
mender systems [26]. In content based approach, the recommendations are based on
contents or properties of items that are of interest to a user [109]. The collaborative
based approach provides recommendations based on users having similar interests to
the user in question [111]. The knowledge based approach makes use of the data
124
pertaining to the user’s needs and preferences to recommend a suitable option [29].
The demographic based approach aims to group or cluster the users based on per-
sonal attributes and make recommendations based on the demographic group a user
belongs to [92]. Despite of some di?erences, all of these approaches require some
sort of intelligent mechanisms to make e?ective recommendations. The collaborative
based approach is comparatively more popular and successful way for building rec-
ommender systems [111]. In addition, the demographic based approach is sometimes
treated and considered as an extension of the collaborative based approach [2]. For
these reasons, we focus on collaborative and demographic based recommendations in
this research.
The rough set theory has recently gained some attention in the recommender
systems research [20, 34, 61, 64, 82, 110]. It has been used with di?erent intends
in designing, developing and implementing recommender systems, such as, to obtain
rules for determining the competence of players in a game [34], to visualize user pref-
erences in menu selection [64], to reduce attributes for determining useful keywords
in web page recommendations [20] and to deal with the problem of missing ratings
(also termed as the problem of sparsity) [61]. The work presented in this research
is di?erent from existing work in three ways. Firstly, we look at multiple aspects of
recommendation decisions simultaneously. Secondly, we go beyond the basic capa-
bilities of rough sets by merging and combining it with the ?eld of game theory in a
GTRS model. Thirdly, we focus on ternary decision making aspect of rough sets for
recommendations.
Three-way or ternary decisions are obtained with probabilistic rough set models
125
when the positive, negative and boundary regions are interpreted as regions of accep-
tance, rejection and deferment decisions [141]. The con?guration of thresholds play a
crucial role in obtaining suitable decision regions [14]. Setting the thresholds in order
to decrease the number of deferment decisions improves the generality but results
in many incorrect acceptance and incorrect rejection decisions. On the other hand,
adjusting the thresholds to obtain more accurate decisions leads to many deferment
decisions. How to obtain thresholds in order to balance the properties of accuracy
and generality is a major obstacle in obtaining an e?ective probabilistic model. We
employ the game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model for such a purpose.
Inchapter5,theapplicationofGTRSwaselaboratedforprovidingusefuldecision
support in WMDSS [132]. In this chapter, we extend these results to investigate and
examine the GTRS model in the context of WRS. Speci?cally, we focus on determin-
ing a tradeo? solution between the properties of accuracy and generality of rough set
based recommendations. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 6.2
elaborates rough sets based recommendations and explains how the properties of ac-
curacy and generality a?ect these recommendations. In Section 6.3, a GTRS based
approach for threshold determination is presented that considers a tradeo? solution
between the properties of accuracy and generality. Finally, Section 6.4 contains ex-
perimental results with the proposed approach on movielens dataset. Comparisons
with the Pawlak model are also presented.
6.2 Rough Sets based Recommendations
An important result of probabilistic rough sets is that the decisions of objects be-
longing to any of the three regions are a?ected and determined by ( ) thresholds.

Consider making recommendation decisions with the probabilistic rough set model.
Di?erentrecommendationsmaybepossibleforthesameobjectwhendi?erentthresh-
old values are being used. This means that a particular item recommended with a
certain threshold settings may be deferred or even not recommended with another
threshold settings. How di?erent threshold levels will a?ect the overall quality of
recommendation decisions is a critical issue in this context. We look at the proper-
ties of accuracy and generality to evaluate the quality of recommendations based on
di?erent threshold values.
The property of accuracy measures how close a recommender system predictions
are to the actual user preferences. Generally speaking, from the early recommender
systems to date, the majority of the published work remained focused on di?erent
ways of measuring this property to evaluate recommender systems [59]. Mcnee et
al. argued that accuracy is not the only indicator of measuring or evaluating the
performance of recommender systems [76]. Herlocker et al. [58] discussed and points
towards additional evaluation properties beyond the accuracy including the property
of generality or coverage. The property of generality is interpreted and de?ned in
di?erent ways [58]. In this chapter, it is considered as the relative number of users
for whom we actually make recommendation predictions. The two properties provide
di?erentandcomplimentaryaspectsforevaluatingrecommendationsusingroughsets.
127
6.2.1 Evaluating Recommendations based on Accuracy and
Generality
The relationship between decision thresholds and the properties of accuracy and
generality can be seenvisually byconsidering Figures 6.1(a) - (i). The Figures 6.1(a),
(b) and (c) correspond to the Pawlak model. The Figures 6.1(d), (e) and (f) corre-
spond to probabilistic two-way model and the Figures 6.1(g), (h) and (i), correspond
to probabilistic three-way model. The ovals in these ?gures represent the concept
of interest that we wish to approximate. The small rectangles are the equivalence
classes. The Pawlak positive and negative regions are based on complete inclusion or
exclusion of an equivalence class to be considered in the positive or negative regions.
ThisisshowninFigure6.1(a). Theprobabilistictwo-waymodelisbasedoninclusion
of every equivalence class in either positive or negative region which is shown in Fig-
ure 6.1(d). The probabilistic three-way model use the thresholds ( ) to determine
the inclusion of an equivalence class in any region.
The Figures 6.1(b), (e) and (h) highlight the property of generality of the three
models. The generality in this case corresponds to the area in which useful decisions
in the form of acceptance or rejection (recommend or not recommend) are made.
This region is obtained by taking the union of positive and negative regions. The
Figures 6.1(c), (f) and (i) highlight the accuracy of the three models. It is noted
that although the Pawlak positive and negative regions are completely accurate (no
black region in Figure 6.1(c)), however we may not be able to make useful decisions
for majority of the objects (see Figure 6.1(b)). On the other hand, the probabilistic
two-way decision model allow to make useful decisions for all objects (Figure 6.1)(d),

i.e., alltheobjectsareindecisionregion(Figure6.1(e)), however, itleadstomanyer-
rors as shown by the black colour in Figure 6.1(f). The probabilistic three-way model
aims at making a suitable tradeo? between the two properties leading to e?ective
levels of accuracy and generality as shown in Figure 6.1(h) and (i).
We further highlight the implications of accuracy and generality for recommender
systems by considering an example of collaborative recommendations. Table 6.1 rep-
resents the ratings of users on di?erent movies. A positive sign, i.e., + indicates that
the user has liked the movie and a negative sign, i.e., - indicates that the user did not
liked the movie. Each row in the table represents the ratings of a particular user cor-
responding to four movies. Suppose we are interesting in predicting the users ratings
onMovie4usingroughsetanalysis. OnecannotonlyusepreviousratingsonMovie4
topredicttheratingofanewuseronMovie4. Thishoweverispossiblewhenwehave
additional features of the users or movies such as demographic information or user
ratings on other movies. We make of the rationale of collaborative recommendations
according to which users having similar taste or preferences over the seen movies are
likely to have similar preferences for the unseen movies. This means that the trends
and patterns of user rating on Movie 1, 2 and 3 can be investigated and exploited to
predict the user ratings on Movie 4.
An information table is required to commence with the application of rough sets.
Table 6.1 is essentially an information table since the set of objects (perceived as
users) are described by a set of attributes (user ratings for movies). This means that
we are able to directly apply rough set analysis on Table 6.1. Moreover, Movie 1, 2
and 3 are conditional attributes and Movie 4 is decision attribute in this example.
This means that based on data of Movie 1, 2 and 3, we want to the predict the

decisions (which in this case is the ratings) for Movie 4. One may choose di?erent
subsets of conditional attributes for the same task. A rough set reduct in Table 6.1
may be investigated for this purpose.
Let X represents an equivalence class which is the set of users having the same
i
rating pattern for Movie 1, 2 and 3. Table 6.2 shows the equivalence classes that are
formed based on Table 6.1. The equivalence classes in this case are interpreted as the
groups of users having identical taste or preferences on the considered movies.
The concept of interest in this case is to determine the positive ratings on Movie
4, i.e., Movie 4 = +. We are unable to exactly specify this concept based on the
131

equivalence classes X X . For instance, we are unable to tell wether or not X
1 8 3
belongs to this concept since 4 users in X like the movie and 1 user dislike it.
3
Therefore, we approximate this concept in the probabilistic rough sets framework
using Equations (2.10) - (2.12). The association of each equivalence class X with
i
the concept, i.e., P(C X ) or conditional probability needs to be determined for this
i
purpose which is given by,
Movie 4 = + X

are calculated as 1 0 1 0 0 8 0 75 0 67 0 33 0 2 and 0 0, respectively. These
conditional probabilities represent the level of agreement between similar users to
positively rate the movie. Generally speaking, the users having similar opinions or
preferences on certain items, does not necessarily imply that they will always be in
perfect agreement on other items of interest. The probability of an equivalence class
X is determined as P(X ) = X U which means that the probability of X is

6.2.2 Accuracy and Generality in the Pawlak and Two-way
Models
Let us look at the properties of accuracy and generality in the Pawlak rough set
model. Based on certain thresholds ( ), these measures are de?ned as [14],

The accuracy measures the relative number of correct classi?cation decisions (or rec-
ommendation decisions) for objects compared to the total classi?cation decisions.
The generality measures the number of objects for whom classi?cation decisions can
be made compared to all objects.

These results mean that with the Pawlak model, we are able to make recommenda-
tions that are 100% accurate, however these recommendation are possible for only
23.07% of the users. Arguably, one may want to make recommendations for many
users. This is possible in the probabilistic two-way model.

In general, by decreasing and lowering the expectation of being highly accurate
in all the cases we are able to make recommendations for more users. For instance,
if we lower our expectation of acceptance for recommendation by lowering the value

of from 1.0 to 0.8, then X will also be included in the positive region. This means
3
that for the objects in X , i.e., U U U U U , we predict positive ratings.

However, from Table 6.1 it is noted that 4 out of 5 of these recommendations are
correct, i.e., U has a - rating for Movie 4.

How much to increase the level of generality at the cost of decrease in the level of
accuracy will require some kind of tradeo? analysis between the two properties. The
probabilistic thresholds ( ) controls this tradeo?. Determining e?ective values for
the ( ) thresholds would lead to a moderate, cost e?ective and e?cient levels for
accuracy and generality. We consider the GTRS model for this purpose.
6.3 AnalyzingAccuracyversusGeneralityTradeo?withGTRS
We now investigate the use of GTRS for analyzing the properties of accuracy and
generality of rough sets based classi?cation. In the previous section, the relationship
betweenprobabilisticthresholds and the two considered properties was demonstrated
withanexample. Animportantobservationwasthatthecon?gurationofprobabilistic
thresholds control the tradeo? between the accuracy and generality. We aim to ?nd
a mechanism that e?ectively adjusts the threshold values based on the two properties
using the GTRS model.
6.3.1 FormulatingaGamebetweenAccuracyandGenerality
From description of GTRS in chapter 3, it becomes obvious and apparent that
we need to identify at least three components of a game in order to formulate and
analyze problems with GTRS. This include information about multiple criteria which
135
?,??,?},,,,{?
are players in a game, the strategies or available actions for each player and the
utilities or payo? functions of the players. We begin by identifying these components.
The players should re?ect the overall purpose and intention of the game. The
objectiveinthisgameistoachieveandimprovetheoverallqualityofrecommendation
predictions. Since we are interested in the properties of accuracy and generality, we
consider them as game players. The player set in this case is C = c c with player
1 2
c representingaccuracyandisdenotedasAandplayerc representinggeneralityand
1 2
is denoted as G. The game is to obtain e?ective levels of thresholds by determining
a tradeo? solution between the players.
The players are a?ected by considering di?erent ( ) thresholds. The strategies
which represent possible moves or options available to the players are therefore for-
mulated in terms of di?erent modi?cations or changes in thresholds. Each player will
aim at selecting a strategy that con?gures the thresholds in order to maximize its
bene?ts or utilities. How to formulate strategies in terms of thresholds was recently
being investigated in [11]. The study identi?ed four di?erent approaches to formulate
strategies, including the two ends approach, the middle start approach, the random
approach and the range approach [11]. Nothing signi?cant has been reported to date
which provides evidence with respect to their relative performance. We consider the
two ends approach in this study as this approach provides useful and e?ective results
in the previous studies [10, 14, 57]. Moreover, this approach con?gures the thresholds
from initial values of thresholds ( ) = (1,0) which facilitates a comparison with
the Pawlak model which is o? particular interest in this study. In conclusion, three
types of strategies are considered, namely, s = (decrease of ), s = (increase
1 2
of ) and s = (decrease of and increase of ).

136
?????????????,??,?},{
The payo? functions are used to measure the consequences of choosing a certain
strategy. They should re?ect possible bene?ts or performance gains of a particular
player in selecting a strategy. As discussed above, the players A and G representing
accuracy and generality are a?ected by considering di?erent threshold values which
are considered as possible strategies. Therefore, the utilities of these two players are
values of accuracy and generality as measured in Equations (6.2) and (6.3). From a
player A’s perspective, an accuracy value of 1.0 means a maximum possible gain or
payo?andanaccuracyof0.0representsaminimumpossiblegain. Inthesameway,for
player G’s perspective, a generality value of 1.0 means a maximum possible gain and
a generality value of 0.0 represents a minimum gain. For a particular strategy pro?le,
say (s s ) that con?gures and lead to thresholds ( ), the associated certainty or
m n
utility of the players are represented by,
u (s s ) = Accuracy( ) (6.8)
A m n
u (s s ) = Generality( ) (6.9)
G m n
where u and u represent the payo? functions of players A and G, respectively.

The payo? table shown as Table 6.4 is constructed for this purpose. Each row of the
payo? table represents the strategies of player A and each column represents the
strategies of player G. Every cell in the table corresponds to a certain strategy pro?le
of the form (s s ). The payo?s corresponding to the strategy pro?le ( s s ) are

weexaminehowtodeterminethevaluesforthevariablesinEquation(6.12)and(6.15)
based on a repetitive game mechanism.
6.3.3 Repetitive Threshold Learning with GTRS
Modifying the thresholds continuously to improve the utility levels of the play-
ers will lead to a learning mechanism. The learning principle employed in such a
mechanism is based on the relationship between modi?cations in thresholds and their
impact on the utilities of players. We exploit this relationship in order to de?ne the
+ ++
variables ( ). This will help in continuously improving the thresholds
to reach their e?ective values. A repeated or iterative game is considered to achieve
this.
Let ( ) represent the initial threshold values for a particular iteration of the

game. Thegamewilluseequilibriumanalysistodeterminetheoutputthresholdpair,
say ( ). Based on the thresholds ( ) and ( ), we de?ne the four variables
that appeared in Equations (6.12) - (6.15) as,

The threshold values for the next iteration are updated to ( ). The variables in

The iterative process stops when either the boundary region becomes empty, or the

6.4 Experimental Results and Discussion
6.4.1 ThresholdCalculationandRecommendationswithGTRS
We elaborate the role of GTRS for threshold determination by considering the ex-
ample discussed in Section 6.2. Considering a game as discussed above in Section 6.3
between accuracy and generality having three strategies each. For the sake of sim-
plicity, we consider a non-repeated (one time) game where an increase or decrease of
25% inthresholdsareconsidered. The game is being playedwith an initial thresholds
of ( ) = (1 0). A particular strategy, say s is now interpreted as 25% decrease

in which leads to = 0 75. Thresholds corresponding to a strategy pro?le are cal-
culated according to two rules. If both the players suggest to increase or decrease a
threshold,anewvalueforthethresholdwillbedeterminedasthesumoftwochanges.
In case a single player suggests a change in the thresholds, the threshold value will
be determined as an increase or decrease suggested by that player. For instance,
thresholds values corresponding to a strategy pro?le say ( s s ) = (25% decrease in
1 2
, 25% increase in ) will be determined as ( ) = (0 75 0 25). Finally, the utility
of the two players are determined using Equations (6.8) and (6.9).
Table6.4representsthepayo?tablecorrespondingtothisgamebasedonthedata
in Table 6.1. The cell containing bold values, i.e.,(0.83,0.89) with its corresponding
strategy pro?le ( s s ) is the Nash equilibrium or game solution. This means that
2 3
none of the two players achieve a higher payo?, given the other players chosen action.
The thresholds based on this strategy pro?le is given by ( ) = (0 75 0 5). The
GTRS based results for predicting user ratings on Movie 4 are interpreted as follows.
We are able to make 83% correct predictions for 89% of the users when we reduce
and set the levels for acceptance and rejection of recommendations for the movie at
0.75 and 0.5, receptively. Comparing these results with the Pawlak model, the GTRS

is able to make recommendations for an additional 66% of the users at a cost of only

Pawlak model are 100% and 23.07%, respectively, as discussed in Section 6.2.

user group or an equivalence class X that has the same rating pattern as that of the

P(Movie 4 = + X ) is used to make a recommendation decision as follows.

be used to determine whether or not to recommend a movie while ensuring that these
recommendations are based on 89% of the users having an accuracy level of 83%. It

in cases where the available information is insu?cient to decide whether or not to
recommend an item. Whereas conventional approaches are generally based on two-
way classi?cation, the chances of misclassi?cations are more in situations that lack
su?cient information to reach a certain conclusion.

6.4.2 Experimental Setup and Data
We investigate the usage of GTRS in movie recommendations. The movielen
dataset is typically considered for movie recommendation application [1, 78]. The
version1Mofthemovielen whichcontainsabout1millionuserratingsisconsideredin
thischapter. Thedatasetconsistsofthreedi?erenttables, namely, theusertable, the
ratings table and the movie table. The user table contains demographic information
about the 6,040 users including their ages, genders and occupations. The movie table
containsinformationabout3,952moviesincludingtheirtitlesandgenres. Theratings
tablecontains1millionuserratingsona5-starscale. Eachuserhasatleast20ratings
in this table.
For ease in computations, we reduced and considered the ratings of about 400
users which resulted in about 58,000 user ratings. In addition, we converted the 5-
star scale to a binary scale (“like”, dislike”) as discussed in reference [101]. Two
sets of experiments were conducted based on this conversion. In the ?rst setup, the
ratings of 4 or 5 indicate “like” while ratings of 1 to 3 indicate “dislike” and in the
second setup only rating 5 indicate “like” while the remaining indicate “dislike”. The
second setup is similar to the problem of predicting the rating 5 for the movies. We
call the ?rst setup as Task 1 and the second setup as Task 2. We also reduced the
numberofmoviestothetop10mostfrequentlyratedmoviesbytheusers(irrespective
of their ratings). In case of missing ratings, we use a value of 0. The prediction on
each movie was considered based on the user ratings for the other nine movies. For
testing the results, 10 fold cross validation was used in all experiments.

6.4.3 Collaborative Recommendations
Table 6.5 presents the results on the training data of Task 1. The Pawlak model
achieves 100% accurate predictions for predicting user ratings on the movies. How-
ever, these predictions are possible for a certain portion of the users, for instance, in
case of Movie 1, these predictions are possible for 64.81% of the users and for Movie
2 they are applicable to 68.78% of the users (the bold point form in the Table 6.5
and hereafter represents the best results). Arguably, one would like to extend these
predictions to cover more users. The GTRS make it possible by allowing a slight
decrease in accuracy. For instance, in case of Movie 1, the GTRS provide an increase
in the generality by 30.59% at a cost of 8.6% decrease in accuracy.
An important issue while considering and comparing the performances of three-
way decision models is that they require additional information for some objects that
belong to the boundary region. In the absence of such information, one may not be
very con?dent and will have remaining doubts about their performances. We look

at the performances of the two models in a worst case scenario where we have no
access to additional information and we are asked to make certain decisions about
the deferred cases. Suppose random decisions are being made with a 50% chance of
being correct and another 50% of being incorrect. Under these conditions, the GTRS
forMovie1provides91 40%correctdecisionsfor95 4%oftheobjectsand50%correct
decisions for the remaining 4 6% of the objects. The average or weighted accuracy in
thiscaseis(91 4 95 4)+(50 4 6) = 89 50%. Inthesameway, thePawlakmodelfor
Movie 1 provides 100% correct decisions for 64 81% of the objects and 50 0% correct
decision for the remaining 35 19% of the objects leading to an average accuracy of
(100 64 81)+(50 35 19) = 82 40%. These accuracies are shown in the fourth and
?fth columns of Table 6.5 under the title of Weighted acc.
Another interesting aspect of the two models is their requirement for additional
information. For the objects in boundary regions, it is generally assumed that addi-
tional information is required to make a certain decision about them [39]. Since, in
most if not all cases, the GTRS lead to reduced size of the boundary region compared
to the Pawlak model, it means that the GTRS will require comparatively lesser ad-
ditional information for the undecided objects. For instance, for Movie 1, the GTRS
require additional information for 4.6% of the objects while the Pawlak model needs
additional information for 35.19% of the objects.
Let us look at the average performance of the two models over the 10 prediction
problems. The Pawlak model provides 100% accurate predictions for 79.75% of the
users. The GTRS provide 96.41% accurate predictions for 95.57% of the users. This
means that when we decrease the accuracy level by 4.14%, we are able to extend
the recommendation decisions to 15.82% of the users. Moreover, the GTRS provide

The results on testing data of Task 1 are presented in Table 6.6. The GTRS
provide comparatively better accuracy for 7 out of 10 movies, i.e., for Movies 1, 3,

an average increase of 11.7%. The weighted accuracy is 61.15% which is 2.18% more
than the Pawlak.
Let us now look at the results for Task 2. Tables 6.7 presents the training re-
sults which are similar to the training results in Table 6.5. There are however some
di?erences in the testing results which are presented in Table 6.8. Overall we note
an increase in the accuracy of the two models. Compared to the testing results for
Task 1, these results are more encouraging for GTRS. The GTRS outperform the
Pawlak model in all aspects. The average results further substantiate this. An aver-
age accuracy of 74.21% is determined which is 2.13% higher than the Pawlak. The
generality is 95.89% compared to 88.16% and the weighted accuracy is 73.26% versus
69.69%.

6.4.4 Demographic Recommendations
Inordertogainfurtherinsightsintotherelativeperformanceofthetwomodels,we
considered the demographic based approach to recommendations. The demographic
information of the users were extracted from the user table of the movielen dataset
for this purpose. Information tables (similar to Table 6.1) are then created based on
the extracted users information. This allows for the application of rough set based
techniques for demographic based recommendations.
Tables 6.9 and 6.10 present the training and testing results for the Task 1. The
trendinthetrainingresultsareverysimilartotheresultsobtainedwithcollaborative
based approach in Tables 6.5 and 6.7. The testing results are however di?erent
compared to the results with collaborative based approach. The Pawlak model in
this case provides better accuracy. This however is not always the case for the results
of weighted accuracy, for instance, in case of Movies 2, 6 and 10. The generality
results are consistent with the previous results. The GTRS signi?cantly improve the

of GTRS is lesser (79.59% compared to 83.58%), the weighted accuracy is better
(65.48% versus 61.31%). The average generality of GTRS is 52.8%, which is 19.32%

6.4.5 Further Analysis
Figure 6.2 summarizes the average results for predicting the 10 movies using the
collaborative based approach. Each set of 6 bars represents the results corresponding
to either the train or test data for the two tasks. The bars with pattern of rectangles
and the bars with pattern of grid represent the accuracy obtained with GTRS and
the Pawlak models, respectively. The bars pattern of single sloped lines and the bars
with the pattern of group of three sloped lines represent the weighted accuracy of
GTRS and the Pawlak models, respectively. The white and black bars shows the

generality of GTRS and Pawlak, respectively. From the bars with pattern of rect-
angles, it is noted that Pawlak model always provide 100% accuracy for the training
data. The bars with grid pattern suggest that GTRS also achieve high accuracy on
the training data above 95%. Moreover, the GTRS improve the accuracy on the test-
ing data. Comparing the bars of weighted accuracies suggest that the GTRS provide
better weighted accuracy compared to Pawlak irrespective of training or testing data.
Inthesameway, lookingatthewhiteandblackbars, wenotethatGTRSalwayspro-
vide better generality. This means that we need lesser additional information about
the remaining cases which are being classi?ed into the boundary region.
Figure6.3summarizestheresultsofthedemographicbasedapproach. ThePawlak
model provides better accuracy and weighted accuracy results for Task 1. However,
the di?erence between the two weighted accuracies on testing data is not very sig-
ni?cant. One may accept this performance decrease for GTRS keeping in view the
improvements it provides in the generality aspect. On Task 2 the GTRS not only
Figure 6.4: Summary of additional results for collaborative based recommendations
152
Figure 6.5: Summary of additional results for demographic based recommendations
matches the testing accuracy of the Pawlak model but also provides comparatively
better weighted accuracy results. The generality of GTRS is superior in all the cases.
In order to further con?rm the validity of our results, we consider the ratings
of another 400 of the users. This time it resulted in around 65,000 ratings. Ex-
perimental setups were created as described in Section 6.4.2. Figures 6.4 and 6.5
summarize these additional results which are similar to the initial results presented
in Figures 6.2 and 6.3. This further validates our experimental results. The details
of these additional results are provided in Appendix A.
To determine if the di?erence between the mean results, presented in Figure 6.2
and Figure 6.3 are statistically signi?cant, we use the standard paired samples t-test
with signi?cance level of = 0 05. Since, we want to test if the mean of one method
is greater than the other, we used a one tail t-test. The null hypothesis and alternate
hypothesis are de?ned as,

the Pawlak model. It should be noted that there are some negative t values in this
table. They are caused by the order in which the values are considered and re?ect
the superiority of the Pawlak model. The hypothesis testing in this case is done by
considering the absolute t value. It should however be noted that the acceptance of
hypothesis H in this case would suggest the superiority of GTRS over the Pawlak.

Speci?cally, H will suggest that the mean of the results with Pawlak is statistically
1
signi?cant than the mean of the GTRS.
From Table 6.13 it becomes more obvious that for collaborative approach, the
means of the results with GTRS are signi?cantly better than the Pawlak model in
all aspects. In the demographic approach, the Pawlak model is only superior based
on the mean of accuracy results. These results provide further con?rmation of the
conclusions discussed earlier.

change over the time, such as, additional information is gathered about the users or
items. The thresholds may need to be updated based on the new data. Di?erent
approaches may be used to determine and update the threshold values in such cases.
One such approach can be a sliding window approach [35]. The size or length of the
window de?ned with the approach may identify the data to be used in determining
155
thethresholds. Thewindowmaybeupdatedeverytimewhensomepercentageofnew

similar approach for this purpose can be the moving average approach [119].
The results presented in this section strongly suggest and advocate for the use of
GTRS in recommender systems to obtain recommendations.
6.5 Concluding Remarks
Recommender systems is becoming a popular tool in E-business. We examine
the role of GTRS in the capacity of an intelligent component for making recom-
mendation predictions in recommender systems. Two properties of recommendation
predictions are being focused, i.e., accuracy and generality. In an ideal situation, the
recommender systems are expected to provide highly accurate recommendations for
majorityoftheusers. Thishoweverisnotalwayspossibleandonehastorelyonsome
mechanism for determining a suitable tradeo? between the two properties. The role
and use of GTRS is highlighted for obtaining and ?nding an e?ective and balanced
solution by considering and implementing a game between the properties of accuracy
and generality. Experimental results on movielen dataset suggest that the GTRS not
only improve the generality of recommendation predictions but also provides more
accurate recommendations in some cases. Furthermore, it outperforms the standard
Pawlak model in majority of the cases. These results encourage and advocate for
the use of GTRS as an alternative way for obtaining recommendation predictions in
recommender systems.
The ultimate success of any recommender system is in the appreciation of its
users and the ability of the system to serve their distinct needs. While we try to
156
optimize the parameters in the global perspective, there is a good reason to tune
the parameters for each individual users. This consideration will open the door to
extensive future theoretical and empirical research, bringing personalization to the
GTRS based recommendations.

Chapter 7
Conclusion and Future Work
This chapter conclude the presented work by providing a brief summary of the
contributions and directions for possible future research.
7.1 Conclusions
The probabilistic rough set model is an important extension of the conventional
Pawlak rough set model. It considers the conditional probability between an equiva-
lence class and a set to determine the inclusion of an object in a certain region based
on a pair of thresholds ( ). There are three important issues for any probabilistic
rough set model, namely, the determination and interpretation of the thresholds, the
estimation of conditional probability and the application or usage of decision regions
obtained with the thresholds. We examined the ?rst and the third issues with the
GTRS model.
The determination of thresholds is investigated by considering di?erent games in
GTRS. The primary objective in these games was to incorporate and highlight the
tradeo?perspectivewithGTRSinordertoobtainbalancedandoptimizedthresholds.
158
?,?
Two game formulations are proposed and examined for this purpose. The ?rst game
is based on determining a balance between the uncertainties of the three probabilistic
regions [14]. This game is useful for analyzing the uncertainties involved in rough set
based decision making [14]. The second game is based on the computation of a trade-
o? between the properties of accuracy and generality of rough sets based decision
making [15, 16]. This game is useful to obtain more accurate and more applicable
decisions [15, 16]. The interpretation of thresholds is addressed by explaining and
de?ning the game symbols, components and the internal game mechanism employed
by the GTRS, i.e. the payo? tables and strategy pro?les. The relationship between
a game solution and the ?nally computed thresholds is also explained [17]. Finally,
the usability and bene?ts of decision regions obtained with the GTRS are analyzed
andexplainedforprovidingternarydecisionsupportintwoapplications. Experimen-
tal results suggest that the GTRS based thresholds lead to better recommendations
compared to the Pawlak model in case of recommender systems [15, 16]. Moreover,
the GTRS can reduce the overall uncertainty involved in medical diagnosis decisions
thereby improving the decision support [132, 133].
7.2 Summary of Contributions
There are four major contributions of this thesis: interpretation of equilibria in
the GTRS, analysis of decision uncertainty, examination of GTRS based thresholds
for three-way decisions and the GTRS application for recommender systems. Below,
I detail each of these contributions as follows.
There was a semantic gap in relating the game solutions in GTRS to the ?nally
computed thresholds [17]. It was not very clear from the existing research as to how
159
the two are related. We overcome this di?culty by reviewing and rede?ning the
key game components, i.e., the players, the strategies and the payo? functions in the
contextofprobabilisticroughsets. Agamesolutionisinterpretedasastrategypro?le
such that for the corresponding threshold pair no player has any unilateral bene?t
or incentive to deviate from these thresholds within the game. Another related and
important issue is the establishment of the existence of a game solution or solutions.
This issue was addressed in a limited context by considering a couple of typical
two players GTRS based games. The results indicate that a game solution may be
established under certain conditions.
The second contribution of this thesis is the investigation of GTRS model to
analyze and reduce the uncertainty in the rough set based decision making. An ex-
amination of the uncertainties involved in di?erent decision regions of the Pawlak
model and probabilistic two-way decision model enabled us to understand that both
of these models may not necessarily provide an overall minimum level of uncertainty.
The Pawlak model only ensure minimum uncertainty for the positive and negative
regions and the two-way decision model only ensure minimum uncertainty for the
boundary region. The probabilistic rough set model is used to ?nd a suitable trade-
o? between uncertainties involved in di?erent decision regions by setting e?ective
( ) threshold values. A two player game was introduced with immediate decision
region (representing the positive and negative regions) and deferred decision region
(representing the boundary region) as game players. The game considered di?erent
threshold con?gurations as possible game strategies in the aim to ?nd an acceptable
solution between the players. A threshold learning mechanism was introduced that

criteria are met. Experimental results on text categorization suggest that the overall
uncertaintyinvolvedinrough sets baseddecisions maybe reduced with the suggested
approach.
The third contribution of this thesis is the examination of GTRS model to induce
ternary decisions. The decisions thresholds determined by the GTRS can be used
to induce three-way decisions in the form of acceptance, rejection and deferment de-
cisions. It is argued that GTRS based ternary decisions are more useful in certain
cases as it provides the ?exibility to incorporate multiple criteria while determining
di?erentdecisionregions. Experimentswereperformedon di?erentmedical diagnosis
problems to analyze the e?ectiveness of GTRS. The results suggest that the GTRS
provides a useful alternative decision making component for providing decision sup-
port in Web-based medical decision support systems.
Finally,thecapabilitiesofGTRSforrecommendersystemsisbeingexamined. Al-
though the property of accuracy provides a reasonable evaluation of the performance
of recommender systems, recent studies suggest that it is not the only indicator for
measuring the performance. Researchers have argued to look beyond accuracy in
order to obtain more interesting and useful results. We considered the property of
generality together with accuracy to obtain recommendations with rough sets. A
game was de?ned that determine a suitable tradeo? between these two properties
leading to more e?ective recommendations. Experimental results on movie recom-
mendation application suggest that GTRS improve the quality of recommendations.

7.3 Future Research
Thereareatleastfourresearchdirectionsthatappearedtomeofpotentialinterest
from investigation of this thesis.
1. This thesis only examine the Nash equilibrium game solution for the GTRS
model. Other kinds of game solutions, such as the minimax, trembling-hand
perfect equilibrium [105], removal of dominated strategies [46], correlated equi-
librium [5] and -Nash equilibrium [99], can also be investigated in the GTRS
model. An interesting issue in this context would be to determine the rela-
tionship between the decision thresholds and a particular type of game solution
under consideration. The other important issue would be to study the implica-
tions of di?erent game solutions for decision making.
2. The existing games in GTRS generally consider a direct modi?cation of thresh-
olds as possible game strategies. This sometimes lead to di?culties in exactly
understanding and interpreting the strategies as decision scenarios from players
perspective. More meaningful ways may be examined for formulating strategies
which may lead to better and more meaningful interpretations.
3. Animportantissueofthree-waydecisionmodelsisthedeterminationofsuitable

The GTRS model may be coupled with these models to obtain and induce
ternary decisions. This may potentially lead to other models such as game-
theoretic shadowed sets.

4. In this thesis we only examine the application of GTRS based three-way de-
cisions in medical decision making and movie recommendations. Ternary de-
cisions can potentially play a vital role in other domains such as spam email
?ltering, document classi?cation, web mining and others. The investigation
of GTRS in such applications will help in better understanding its practical
capabilities.
5. The comparison of GTRS based three-way decisions with conventional two-
way approaches can be another future direction. There are however remaining
issues and challenges that need to be addressed in this regard. Some of these
issues are, 1) The deferment decisions may decrease the number of incorrect
recommendations, i.e., recommendations that are di?cult to decide may be
di?ered. Shouldwepenalizeathree-wayapproachformakingdi?ereddecisions?
if yes how it should be done?, 2) How do we treat the di?ered cases compared
to the errors such as false-positives and false negatives?.
